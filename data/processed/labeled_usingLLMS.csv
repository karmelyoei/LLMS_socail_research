>AI Audits for Transparency

This is also being implemented. Auditing is one of the perfect use cases for RPA. Most of auditing is sample testing for compliance, and comparing the samples against known procedures is fairly easy to set up. The addition of AI enables pattern discovery that may not be obvious such as spending just below material limits, or the use of a specific vendor when better alternatives are available. AI is simply improving existing tools and vastly expanding their data crunching ability. When corporations have millions of transactions daily, such scale is necessary.

AI will be an incredible assistant to support governance, yet should never be the decision-maker. Ideally, AI would process the data and provide various scenarios that a team of experts could select from, and then the AI could assist with the administration and evaluation of the selection. Ultimately, AI will increase the need for expertise rather than diminish it, so we still need people to learn and study various disciplines. 

>That way, everyone can see how decisions are being made and if people in power are being fair.

This is where liberal democracies are failing. As the complexity of society increases, decisions are becoming more opaque. Legislators are rarely experts on what they are regulating, and they increasingly need to rely on non-governmental experts. With the privatization of information, the necessary expertise is becoming more difficult to obtain. Radical transparency is worthless if no one can understand the rationale behind decisions. And no one can understand the rationale behind every decision. The complexity of our systems has long passed the point of generalization. (The expectation that judges are capable of ruling on the technical details of such complex systems is a major reason why overturning the Chevron doctrine is such an absolutely horrible decision. The Roberts court guaranteed that everything will get far worse before anything gets better. The rule of law has become itself illegitimate. Science doesn't care about legal opinions. Mother Nature and Father Time don't give a fig about your political beliefs.)

What then? If liberal representative democracies are incapable, who or what is? I advocate for a radically different form of democracy where everyone is required to participate and collaborate. Legislators would be replaced with ""collegiums"", and everyone would belong to a college. (A foundation would oversee the various colleges and try to ensure each college has enough members. A new college would have to meet a threshold to participate. Details determined later. Some may fade away due to obsolescence.)

A collegium has three main traits. First, the body consists of 'colleges' of experts in various policy areas. The main college would have a broad mandate - commerce, health, education, technology, etc, while subcommittees would focus on specific issues. For example, the college of health would have panels for pediatrics, geriatrics, internal medicine, etc. Second,
each member has approximately equal power yet narrow authority. They can issue decisions on their specialty, but nothing outside of it. Third, decisions would be mainly guidance and only binding if adopted.

The ISO is a primary example of this schema. Technical committees draft and issue standards, yet they are only binding if an organization or a local jurisdiction explicitly adopts them. Anyone can formally withdraw from the standards at any time. The main source of compliance are independent audits that issue opinions on if the standards were followed. An organization that fails an audit would likely be censured by its peers or barred from practice in a particular jurisdiction. 

Governance would not be representative, but delegative. It would not be majoritarian,  but based on consensus and collaboration. It could not be authoritarian since a collegium would have no direct authority. It would be authoritative since they would issue the formal standards. Third parties could still rely on other standards (cf GAAP vs IFRS, or imperial vs metric). An organization would be required to disclose what standards, if any, they have adopted.

What does this mean in practice? Each college would have its own AI to assist with their field. Each college would determine its own criteria for membership, and would support the professional development of its members. Members (i.e., everyone) would have at least one day per week to participate in discussions, attend continuing education seminars, read journals, evaluate proposals or drafts, and finally issue recommendations as needed. When a college has achieved a consensus, they would release a standard or an update. 

To ensure radical transparency, there would be investigators or inspectors. They would have carte blanche to conduct an inquiry and then issue a final report. Intentional interference of an inquiry would lead to public censure. The abuse of an inquiry by an investigator would result in their mandatory resignation if substantiated. 

People could switch colleges if they want to (with an introductory/probationary period to prevent 'brigading'), yet could only belong to one at a time and only serve on one committee at a time. They could attend meetings and otherwise participate in another college, but could not vote or issue recommendations. 

I think AI will be an invaluable resource for governance, but it can never be the actual governor. It can assist with inquiries, but could never be the actual investigator. It can assist with the allocation of resources, but never be the main provisioner.",False,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1fgfkdn/the_3p_lifestyle_a_vision_for_a_future_without/ln748dc/,0.46231481432914734,-1,0.0,2024,2.

AI hysteria is omnidirectional.  
AI is taking over all jobs, but at the same time it's a bubble. These can't be true together.  
It's also expected to kill us all, cause mass psychoses and whatnot.

All that is nonsense. AI is a tool.   
It will not kill us, will not take our jobs, and it's not a bubble.

Layoffs are 100% attributed to AI, but are mainly a normal correction for the over-hiring spree that started during the pandemic. Some businesses may hire less due to AI efficiency gains, but on the other hand - see what's happening around. Datacenters are popping up everywhere, chip factories and power generation are being built all around, and many times more are being designed .. and all these things have supply chains.

All that is AI-created jobs.  
With the massive re-shoring trend currently underway, I don't see the demand for jobs going down for the foreseeable future - quite the opposite. In fact, the only way to fill the huge demand-supply gap is robots + AI.
