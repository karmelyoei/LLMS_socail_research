Overall what I see actually likely to happen is just more of the same corporate fuckery, ""well if 1 person can do the work of 6 with AI then we only need 1 person"" and that 1 person just gets to do more output and still makes the same wage. I don't think it will be given autonomy in my industry just due to risk regulations.

"I think it's totally legitimate to be worried about this tech being used responsibly and for the good of all. However that for me is the crux of the matter, as I don't think AI is inherently pro- or anti-human. Your take is therefore one of a pessimist, rather than a humanist. 

Our present system requires that a majority of humans rise every day to work in jobs that are menial and even degrading, just to earn the right to shelter and nourishment. I don't see how defending this system can be considered pro-human if there's even a glimmer of hope for an alternative, one that would liberate the average person to live a more meaningful life. Those that do defend it probably don't realize their position of extreme privilege (you talk a lot about artists who are an extremely small category of people). 

However it will be a huge challenge to reap the benefits (to keep these new ""means of production"" from accruing only to the rich and powerful) and to reimagine what a ""meaningful life"" means. 

To me there's plenty of hope and potential.

This is a huge part to what I was saying: yes, our system sucks. I used to be registered DSA for a reason, because I'm staunchly anti-capitalist. AI as it has been seen, is exclusively also capitalist though. There's been so many CEOs (the CEO of Nvidia, which is in terms of evaluation the most profitable company on the planet many quarters) that have praised AI as a means of cutting people out of their work force in ways so rapid that they have never been seen before. 

Yes, it sucks working these jobs, but what's the alternative right now? If AI in 3 years raised unemployment by we'll say 0.5%, what do those 500,000 or so Americans do for instance? They can't just coast along waiting for AI to trickle down and benefit them when they have to deal with our near-nonexistent welfare system. And even if we had a welfare system, there's at least some argument about people's worth that's very fair to have.

1. **llms as local retrieval agents > “smart inboxes”** what you needed wasn’t autocomplete or a better UI — you needed a semantic retrieval layer over your entire personal corpus (emails, PDFs, attachments, dates, etc.). think local vector db + chunked embeddings + a fine-tuned, context-aware agent that knows how to “think like you” across time. this isn’t GPT-as-a-chatbot. it’s GPT-as-an-assistant wired directly into your life.
2. **products guess; tools obey.** most ai *products* are built for average-case users and safe defaults. but real productivity comes from *tools* that are shaped to your workflow, quirks, and context — in this case, your inbox history, language patterns, and even the way your office manager titles documents. open-source stacks like `llamaindex` \+ `rag` \+ local LLMs (mistral, llama3, or ollama backends) let you build this with privacy and full control.

**bottom line:**  
ai as a product is often flashy and useless. ai as a tool — deployed on your terms, into your mess — is where it gets magical.

"Totally fair to ask. MEP isn’t using AI to replace human intuition or reinvent the wheel—it’s designed to support workers and managers in high-stress, variable conditions like BOH kitchens. Think of it less like automation and more like real-time scaffolding: things like surfacing reminders when someone’s pulling double shifts, suggesting prep roles based on known strengths or fatigue, or nudging new hires with walkthroughs when they’re thrown into a rush. Templates are useful, but in most kitchens I’ve worked in, those break down fast when chaos hits. MEP is about helping teams adapt in those edge moments.

“What AI are you talking about using?”

Right now, I’m experimenting with lightweight, explainable models—nothing black-box or fully autonomous. It’s more rule-assisted logic with AI inputs than straight-up generative autonomy. I’m also aiming for everything to be 100% overrideable, with visibility into the “why” behind suggestions. If it can’t explain itself clearly, it doesn’t belong in the kitchen.

“Are the tradeoffs worth it?”

Good point. I think that’s the heart of it. The tradeoff I’m betting on is that a lightweight, human-centered AI assistant—especially one trained with actual kitchen feedback—can help improve workflow without overwhelming or confusing teams. It’s not about replacing judgment, it’s about supporting it under pressure.

"Last year I used to be an architect soley on the business side of the house but wanted a change, so I leveraged ChatGPT’s unique ability to understand and contextualize information to give me a plan to transition to being an AI / ML Architect at my work . I started by feeding it the top 10 job descriptions for AI/ML Architect roles, allowing it to absorb and analyze the key requirements. Then, using my chat history, I asked ChatGPT to recommend an application idea that would not only teach me those essential concepts but also be something I could use in my everyday life. This personalized approach made learning practical and engaging.

With ChatGPT’s help, I designed the app and broke it down into manageable MVPs. Using AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot and Cursor, I developed each piece while getting detailed explanations of every major design and development decision. This hands-on project became my portfolio and proof of concept, enabling me to confidently present my skills to leadership and transition from Solution Architect to AI/ML Architect. On top of that I invited my friends over once a week to do a vibe coding session with me, where we answered and explored each others issues together making me a much stronger communicator. So here is my advice to you.

# Step-by-Step Actionable Plan

**Step 1: Collect and Contextualize Job Descriptions**

* Gather the top 10 AI/ML Architect job descriptions.
* Use ChatGPT to store and analyze these descriptions to understand core requirements and responsibilities.

**Step 2: Leverage ChatGPT with Your Chat History**

* Provide ChatGPT with your chat history and context.
* Ask it to recommend an app idea that teaches the critical AI/ML concepts identified from the job descriptions and fits into your daily life, making learning natural and continuous.

**Step 3: Design and Plan the App Development**

* Have ChatGPT design the app’s architecture and features based on the recommended concept.
* Break down the app into MVPs for step-by-step development.

**Step 4: Develop with AI Coding Assistants**

* Use GitHub Copilot or Cursor to build each MVP.
* After completing each MVP, ask ChatGPT or your assistant for detailed explanations of the design choices and coding decisions to deepen your understanding.

**Step 5: Build Your Portfolio**

* Document your app, development process, and lessons learned.
* Prepare this portfolio to showcase your skills and project experience.

**Step 6: Present Your Work and Advance Your Career**

* Share your completed app and portfolio with your leadership or hiring managers or heck even friends or family or go to tech meetups at [meetup.com](http://meetup.com) and just talk about what your doing alot.
* Use this proof of concept to support your transition into an AI/ML Architect role or title upgrade.

"For AI to replace humans, they generally have to be more productive for a given level of cost compared to humans. So we’d expect overall productivity to increase. There’s no reason to believe there will be mass unemployment unless the value of human labour goes to zero. If it’s not zero, an employer will be willing to pay a wage to a given employee. If average profit margins stay the same (competition puts continued downward pressure on profit margins), since AI increases output we’d expect the output per worker to rise. The mean wages per worker are going to be approximately equal to output per worker multiplied by (1 - profit margins). Since productivity/output is expected to increase, if profit margins stay the same we’d expect the wages per worker to increase. Competition does provided continued downward pressure against profit margins rising, especially if consumers are highly price sensitive. 

Let’s say profit margins do increase though. If profit margins increase they would have to increase in excess of increases in productivity in line with output per worker multiplied by (1 - profit margins). Output per worker also includes work done by AI and machines by the way. It’s just total output divided by the number of workers. 

I’m also using output as a synonym for productivity here. And output is taken to mean gross value added, where gross value added = gross output - intermediate consumption. Gross output is the total sales or production of the establishment. Intermediate consumption is everything the firm buys from other firms (materials, components, business services, energy, etc.). The subtraction leaves only the extra value the enterprise itself creates in the period.

So really whether you think wages are going to increase or decrease is really just a question of whether you think the output per worker is going to increase faster than profit margin increases or if profit margins are going to increase faster than total output.",-1,0.0,2025

White collar workers have a tendency to radically underestimate the difficulty of blue collar work, especially the intellectual side of it. They tend to think if they were to reskill, it'd be manageable, but they think you need the degree and shit to do the white collar job (legally true or true by hiring practices sometimes, but I'm talking underlying skill). 

Realistically, most white collar workers would do jobs like Walmart employee or warehouse entry grunt that are physical and won't be replaced by ai, but don't require much in terms of skill. There's not just gonna be a bunch of 40 year old lawyers being taken on as plumbing apprentices and doing a good job. Trades will be fine, but the idea of someone in a vulnerable position being like ""I'll just be a plumber"" makes absolutely no sense.

I feel like the difference is physical results in real time. If someone is good at reading legal cases, conscientious about learning citation practices, and makes a good legal argument, then there's nothing practical to look at and so you trust the expert or the paperwork to certify it as good. The credible certifiers won't look at you without a JD so most people just have reddit comments begin with IANAL and nobody checks the quality in any serious way, and so people don't try to hone skill here. For fixing pipes though, not that hard to tell if it works or how long it takes for a pipe to break. That means there's no mask and so blue collar professionals can't hide when there's a talented layman. It creates an illusion of accessibility and blue collar has a culture to support that.

If the people making the same arguments people in this thread were making about technology replacing jobs won out by arguing it would replace jobs,  increase unemployment, lower wages etc–if they won out and America was still 60-80% farming America would have much lower wages much more similar to how Africa is right now.

Chances are assistive agents will improve productivity and the ROI of thinkers making human workers more valuable. Ultimately the bar will be raised and we will expect more from people. That also means that these singular monolithic models will be less useful by comparison unless we really do achieve true AGI.

I think the future appears to be swarms of hyper focused agents, all speaking to each other to get stuff done. We will automate parts of work that don’t require much thought and leave the thinking for the heavy parts of things, and it seems to me like we are skipping the automation of all of these annoying, low thought processes and going straight for full replacement of professions which is a Hail Mary IMO.

"I think the flaw is in the definition of skilled labour (especially the coding part). Cheaply putting together a quick prototype is completely possible with AI, but the AI generated code should never be trusted for production systems. All it means is that 80% of the boring part of coding can be automated, which is usually abstracted away anyway by writing API glue code or fancy application-specific programming paradigms. As a result, the people at risk are the people who were paid to glue everything together and neither actively solved hard problems (i.e system design / architecture) or intricate low-level infrastructure.

The real difficulty (and very high human value) is when you have to write intricate systems with creative solutions that solve hard problems. In these scenarios, developers will have reached the point where they don't think about the code at all, they just think about how they solve it and the code is a means to an end to define a system that automatically achieves your end goal. 

The truth is that tooling always changes every few years: 10 years ago, Julia and Python significantly reduced the amount of Java/C/C++ flying around and infinitely lowered the bar to entry. Arguably, AI has had the same effect again and people generally shift into either category (learning your environment is a huge part of programming). However, you wouldn't ever write a kernel or compiler in Python, or a large system like reddit into C (unless you had to for a specific reason). AI is great for those solving the bigger picture and in the long term essentially becomes another (optional) layer of glue, analoguous to a compiler (the program that takes your behavioral specification, i.e C++ code, and turns it into instructions that computers understand).

I believe that society will reflect this. Tools with comparable impact to that of AI are occasionally introduced into the programming world (every 10-15 years), and all it does is automate the ""boring"" work and allows people to focus their attention on the fun, new stuff. This isn't the mass automation of skilled labour as there is simply too much scope for one thing/program/person to innovate at every layer of abstraction simultaneously.

"As an economist, I second that.

If you were to describe the shift within a neoclassical framework, you would simply increase the technological multiplier that translates labor and capital inputs to the macroeconomic production function.

Both human labor and capital increase their productive output. That's basically it.

In microeconomic perspective, you can ask whether this compares to a positive supply shock in the labor market that temporarily increases unemployment and possibly an adaption of the demand side in the long run.

Let's say it with F. Knight:

Economics analyses the use of finite resources that meet infinite human desires.

This implies that AI will give an increased production potential, but we will eventually adapt, consume more, and end up employing the freed-up resources just in a different way.

In simpler terms: We are greedy. Therefore unemployment will be only temporary, because if labor and capital are available, we will use them to have more.

"“Replacement theory” sells to much better to customers and investors. It’s the path to higher valuations in the VC and IPO game. It’s the path to easier sales to customers. 

Replacing workers solves a pain point for most businesses. It’s an easy story to tell. It gets meetings with the C suite. It’s disruptive. It makes for huge new initiatives to get promotions and press. It’s offers dramatic and fast improvements. You become a strategic partner with big customers. You are selling corporate heroin, it feels great and gets rid of all kinds of pain points. It can increase bonuses this quarter. 

Improving productivity is a very different story. It’s a vitamin not a pain killer. The customer gets a long messy journey with lots of work and mistakes. You sell to directors or group managers. They struggle to quantify the benefits and explain how it’s used. The C-suite doesn’t have time to learn about it, and it hardly affects their bonus. The solution turns into another IT expense and easily fades into objectives for the year. It’s just another tool to meet targets. The only tangible benefit shows up as reduced headcount growth, not immediate savings … and that is hard  to measure.

Given the choice to sell pain killers or sell vitamins, the pain killers will be a lot more lucrative. Employees are always a cost center and for many leadership teams they are also a pain. Eliminating employees now is a pain killer. That is why they sell replacement theory.

So we've got two options here, as I see it.

Option 1 is that we accept ripping off the bandaid is going to hurt, and then we do it, and it hurts for a bit, and the world is better.

Option 2 is that we say ""well, the entire country is owned by the wealthy, nothing can ever change again. Oh well!

Silicon Valley (and capitalism, more generally) is rife with instances of rivals and competitors ""stealing"" ideas from each other.  Gates and Jobs.  Etc.  This is nothing new, I'm just saying that AI is a tool uniquely-equipped and -positioned to assist in that process (because what it does - ALL it does - is sift through massive datasets looking for correlations, and thus widens the scope of whose ideas can be semi-easily poached.)

The idea that these things are not going to be used for idea-poaching seems naive to me, especially given, as I said, they were *trained* thus, and tech companies are ALREADY harvesting data from us for moneymaking purposes.  Who are you?  What do you like?  What will you buy?  How can you be persuaded?  How can advantage over you best be secured?

And yes, right now AI draws a LOT of bad conclusions from what it sees.  But its hit-rate is increasing, and like I said the play I see would simply be for it to forward the ideas that are deemed most-likely-to-succeed to humans (that are better-backed than you and I, with massive resources, money, and tech) for further evaluation and winnowing and pursuit.  AI would simply function as a triage, a skimmer.  (And again, this is one thing that for ex. Palantir already wants to use it for or is already using it for - looking for indications that, say, you're a potential terrorist or assassin and sending that to LEOs or intelligence agencies.)

What does the hit rate of that skimming have to be, to make it worthwhile?  If it gets it right 25% of the time and the other 75% of the ideas it forwards to the humans are hallucinated nonsensical garbage, maybe that's plenty good-enough to keep on pushing the tech companies' bank accounts ever-higher.

"I made exactly that same point, which is why I quoted myself.

The actual point I’m making is that these are perfectly-positioned as intermediaries to make sure no original idea from a regular human ever beats an AI version to market; and the AI‘s will not be owned by you and me (at least, not the best ones).

Just like social media, Silicon Valley isn’t building AI out of the goodness of their hearts to selflessly-help all mankind; there’s always and ever even more money to be made, and just as they hope to use all prior human art as AI starter fuel, any future notional human art will, I strongly suspect, be just more grist for the mill.  Our data, our speech, our ideas are gold to be mined for them.  This is already happening today, and will accelerate exponentially.

If you’ve got any good million-dollar ideas or think you might one day, if I were you I’d make sure you’re only ever researching anything at all related to them on local models…and better yet, at least until you’ve made some real headway, maybe stick with pencil and paper for now, because AI ability to predict and scoop and leapfrog you will only get faster and better and easier, and your data will be hard to contain; SV wants your data, they always do.

AI is being sold to us as a tool that will help us (and it will, some); but it’s really perfectly positioned to help *them*.   I don’t particularly fear AI per se, but I trust **people** about as far as I can throw ‘em.",-1,0.0,2025
"Well it's why I was thinking of the examples of ride-hailing, desktop publishing, software when PC's came along. Massively disruptive to incumbents but also grew the market exponentially. 

With AI we can get an early taste of that with software dev where it is most disruptive so far (if you aren't familiar with it, there is a real revolution from the ground up just starting). As always happens with these things, there is a lot of early speculation that devs are going to be automated out of jobs (and many business people are buying right into it). 

But if you look at the reality, people are leveraging it to do more. And of course people being people, they are creating new worlds of complexity and emerging specialisation about how to use the AI's. We are right at the start and this already goes way beyond clever prompts - to frameworks of rules, automated project management, prompts that create prompts, evaluation frameworks, agent orchestration, running multiples and having an LLM choose a winner etc - all automated of course. There is also a whole new wave of youtube influencers and new entrants for whom the barrier to coding has been dismantled. To me that paints a picture of massive job and industry growth as it matures.

I think the OP's mistake is a common one, to assume that people don't do that kind of thing whenever a technology shows up and instead of leveraging it they are somehow at its whim. There's a fear of commoditisation - it's quaint now but we even saw that with the introduction of pocket calculators. But commoditisation creates low prices and standardisation - and that creates platforms that people can build on. Every technology is like this. Electricity was high priced and specialised at first, but the grid and electricity in every home allowed TV sets (which at first were expensive and specialised), TV sets in every home allowed networks, networks allowed production companies and grew the ad industry beyond recognition.

"It just won’t. AI has some brilliant applications in science, and I use it as someone with adhd to help me sort of my ideas (I just talk to it about something I’m thinking about that I already know about and the resultant conversation helps organise my thoughts) or make check lists for organisation. It’s helpful for plenty of applications. But it can’t take over most people’s jobs. AI hallucinates all the time, and doesn’t actually understand what anything it’s saying is. It’s not “intelligent”. It just generates the statistically most likely response that it thinks you want based on its programming. It still needs humans to check all its work. It can’t make decisions in the same way humans can. 

It should be used for automation in a few niche areas or as I said before - in scientific applications where AI agents can be trained to detect patterns and information that humans might miss. But that’s not 75% of all jobs. 

I genuinely find it baffling to imagine AI working even in a customer service role. If you can you’ve obviously never worked in such a role. Sure if the human customers acted like robots and never requested weird information or never had a complaint that had any complexity to it. What about discretion? Humans have so much more information that we take in over our lifetimes that allow us to risk assess, make decisions, and decide on outcomes. Can you really think of *every possible* scenario and then programme the AI to know how to respond? 

One thing that always gets me about this is that in reality service workers, office workers etc know that occasionally you have to break some rules. For example say you give a refund to someone that’s technically not within the rules but it’s discretionary because you know that there are circumstances surrounding the situation where it’s just not fair to tell the customer to fuck off. You’ve possibly secured a far more loyal customer for that even though it broke a small rule. This can be extrapolated to so many different scenarios in offices and workplaces where breaking one rule ensures that many other benefits can be achieved but takes experience in the industry, real human intelligence and knowledge to know what to do. 

We’ve all worked in environments where a boss has put something in place that is so ridiculous, and though they think it saves the company time and money it actually wastes money and time and makes the customers much more unhappy. With human employees they’re able to explain why it’s bad in practice to a boss who may well have never actually done the job. AI isn’t going to be able to think outside the box and say “this doesn’t work but here’s a good solution” because it’s only ever able to be trained on data sets of previous knowledge. 

So do we then just accept that the very rich people who are in charge of companies get to put this in place where everything becomes dramatically worse, where all customers are pissed off with all companies but the CEOs make more and more money? Why is that okay? 

Even leaving aside what the hell all the unemployed people are going to do. The US government certainly wouldn’t implement universal basic income and neither would most other countries.

"AI taking human jobs is a challenge but it has a flip side which is potentially very good news.  That is, the growth rate of the economy will no longer be limited by the amount of ""labor"" available to combine with ""capital"".  Until now, economic experts would generally say that for a ""mature"" economy (like the US), the maximum sustainable  rate of growth of GDP is 3-4% per year.  Why? Because the available labor force doesn't grow very fast and producing goods and services has required both capital and labor inputs. So if the labor part is growing slowly, the overall growth of the economy is limited.  

If everything can be produced by capital alone (specifically, AI software and robotic hardware) then the limit on how fast the economy can grow (i.e., how much faster we, collectively, can get materially richer) is much, much higher.  Five percent per year? Ten percent?  More? It's not entirely clear what constraints will define the new limit on GDP growth.  

So the challenge is in the ""collectively"" part:  how all this new wealth can be distributed so that everyone ( or at least practically everyone) is better off. That's the standard that defines whether an economic system is serving society. But whether UBI or something else is the answer, it's not enough to change how income is distributed.  We also have to do that without ruining the capital-allocation side of our (sort-of) market economy.  Because it's the market-based capital-allocation (i.e., production) side of the market that puts the capital to work in an optimal way (from the point of view of efficiently responding to consumer demand.)  The potential for us all to get (materially) better-off faster would be undercut if taking away the incentives that motivate capital allocation decisions are distorted too much by changes in the system of rewards provided by a change is the income-distribution side of the market.",-1,0.0,2025

Technology multiplies good and bad. Civic consciousness is also multiplied by technology, think about where you are and what tools you're using (the internet and computers). Every choice we make matters, and it starts with what we choose to believe. Entropy and chaos make room for new emergent properties to arise.

Short answer, no! I am not scared, I am rather excited. AI to business is like automation to manufacturing! It is a huge leap. Will some jobs be displaced? Of course, but that has always been the case for humanity, it is one of the ways we evolve, and success demands flexibility.

Now for my personal work, I used to have a particular niche before the rise of LLMs; I used to be the person who can develop in low-level deep learning frameworks (tensorflow and pytorch), before 2023, I was viewed as a critical asset, because not enough people are comfortable debugging, fixing, and developing in these frameworks.

Then it hit me when I tried out LLMs for the first time; despite being inaccurate, it makes my niche very attainable to others in the field. But I am also very thankful to it, because I no longer need to spend 90% of my time developing in DL frameworks or spend hours on forums and stackoverflow. Instead, this now takes less than 50% of my time, which allowed me to expand my skillset to other areas, including devops, APIs, logging, UI. I am better because of AI, I am not replaced by it.

And honestly, I realize that those who are most annoyed by it are folks in the creative space. Though I want to argue that AI is merely challenging these folks to filter only for the exceptional talents... It is basically survival of the fittest.

To begin to see the problem, recall that in previous eras innovations created high value occupations by automating or obviating those of lower value. This led to a heuristic that those who fear innovation do so because of a failure to appreciate newer opportunities. Software, however is different in this regard and the basic issue is familiar to any programmer who has used a debugger. Computer programs, like life itself, can be decomposed into two types of components:

>1) Loops which repeat with small variations.  
2) Rube Goldberg like processes which happen once.  


>If you randomly pause a computer program, you will almost certainly land in the former because the repetitive elements are what gives software its power, by dominating the running time of most all programs. **Unfortunately, our skilled labor and professions currently look more like the former than the latter, which puts our educational system in the crosshairs of what software does brilliantly**.",-1,0.0,2024

"Humans need not apply. You're right -- what if machines outpace a substantial proportion of intellectual work? I.e., what if they're just *better* than us at all the things we used to think made us uniquely human? 

Here's some common arguments I see against this, and why I think they're pretty transparently wrong:

* ""AI will create more jobs."" If a machine is capable of genuine abstract reasoning, it will be able to do *those* jobs too. Sure, there will be new jobs for a time. But if the tech gets better every year (which it is doing, by the way), and if the explicitly stated goal is artificial general intelligence, then those jobs new jobs will eventually be done better by machines as well. And one day we will make a machine system that is better at us than *all jobs arbitrarily.* Our brain is only so smart, and so fast. It's a physical system with physical limits.
* ""People will just be trained to do other jobs."" See above; but even so, let's stipulate a transition period. And let's say, for the sake of argument, that you're one of the few people who's smart enough and hard working enough to do the new ""AI-proof for a few years"" job. The question is, what is the *rest* of the labor pool doing? Because now you're competing with other smart, driven people for a narrowing pool of employment. Imagine being a grad student in China competing voraciously for a 9-9-6 corporate tech job and working 100 hours a week -- that future, or worse, is in store. Wage is nothing other than a price, for labor, set by the laws of supply and demand. And if supply goes up while demand goes down, so does price.
* ""AI can't be creative."" I hear this a lot from people who I don't think have thought enough about thinking to know how ""non-sacred"" their creativity really is. If you taxonomize the kinds of creative work people do, a lot of it boils down to patterns like: sampling from existing trends in new ways, combining trends, experimenting and iterating until you find a novel idea -- these are all things that machines can do now, in part or in whole. And they will be getting better.
* ""AI can't be strategic."" Tell that to Lee Sedol, who lost to AlphaGo in one of the most complex strategic games ever created.
* ""AI can't be emotional."" AI doesn't feel emotions -- that seems to be pretty clear since emotions are a specific result of neural and hormonal circuits that they don't have an analog for. But AI can definitely emulate the complex, nuanced content of emotional messages, often better than people can. And like just wait 5 years.

All of this is to say, remember that we're on an exponential curve -- LLM pushback be damned. What do people think is going to happen when the *next* big algorithmic advance comes out? It was about a decade from the birth of deep learning to the invention of the transformer, and then only a few years from the invention of the transformer to the LLM... 

I think a lot of people are also pushing back on ideas of AI replacing people because they *need* to, emotionally, in order not to feel a compelling sense of anxiety. But we should be anxious -- it is right to be anxious in the face of the fact that in the future, and perhaps very soon, h*umans need not apply.*",38,1.0,2024

My take is that what we're seeing now is the big pile of jobs people can do better than machines -- which was always finite, because at some point human labor (which is either mechanical, emotional, or intellectual) is finite -- is now getting smaller. And the *rate* at which it's getting smaller is getting faster every year.

I see it as an opportunity, for mankind really, but for America first to take the next step. Work can be optional.

"Hey Hopeful-Reading-6774,

I understand your disillusionment. The ML PhD path can be a grind, and the coding-heavy, publish-or-perish nature isn't for everyone. But your background in electrical engineering combined with your ML knowledge puts you in a unique position to tackle a really interesting, less software-focused problem that has massive (Multi-Trillion Dollar) implications for the future of AI: hardware acceleration for large language models (LLMs).

Instead of dropping out, consider pivoting your research towards this hardware focus. You mentioned being discouraged by the crowded field – well, this is an area ripe for disruption. While everyone's chasing the next SOTA algorithm, the hardware enabling these algorithms is becoming a critical bottleneck. You could carve a niche for yourself by exploring how to bring LLMs, even smaller, highly performant ones like SmolLM2, to more efficient hardware.

Your familiarity with analog and digital circuits will enable you to understand analog ML compute and specifically the Mythic analog MatMul IC.  This is a huge advantage. Imagine developing techniques to upscale these analog MatMul circuits to handle the demands of LLMs. Even focusing on smaller, quantized models like an 8-bit SmolLM2 would be a significant contribution. Think about:

* **Scaling analog MatMul:** How can you interconnect multiple Mythic ICs or design new architectures to handle the larger matrices involved in LLMs? This could involve exploring chip-level interconnects, novel memory hierarchies, or even new analog compute paradigms.
* **Quantization and Precision:** Investigate the trade-offs between model size, performance, and power consumption when using 8-bit quantization with analog compute. This has huge implications for deploying LLMs on edge devices.
* **Hybrid Analog/Digital Architectures:** Perhaps a combination of analog MatMul for the computationally intensive parts and digital logic for other operations is the sweet spot. Your EE background is perfect for exploring this.

This direction lets you leverage your existing skills, sidesteps the pure software rat race, and opens doors to a less crowded, highly impactful area. You'd be working on tangible hardware advancements with clear real-world applications. Plus, the demand for specialized hardware expertise is only going to grow.

Think about it: completing your PhD with a focus on this could land you in a very comfortable, less coding-intensive, and highly technical role designing the future of AI hardware. You'd be making a real difference, rather than chasing incremental improvements in already saturated software domains. Talk to your advisor – they might be very receptive to this shift in focus, especially given the novelty and potential impact. It could revitalize your PhD experience and set you up for a fulfilling and less stressful career.",0,0.9974996497553636,2024

Yeah it's something like Head of R&D but never formally specified and my small ""Labs"" Team all do this type of work.

Ah yes I wanted to mention also because it's becoming more and more rare that we do actual ML work in the sense of building model architectures and training models. I did that for years but that's changing rapidly with big foundation models for each modality.
We had explicit NLP and Audio and CV teams but that's changing.
Even a sales engineer can nowadays just dump images into Claude and let it classify them and directly.make a customer happy in a day if they don't require huge scale or specific latency requirements.
Or just throw CLIP at things, gathering data and training your classifier often not necessary anymore (https://huyenchip.com/assets/pics/multimodal/10-clip-perf.png).

Tons of messing around with NLP models is in many cases just prompting now, if you don't need large scale just even using Claude or whatever is so much cheaper than hosting your own (even the internal support bot costs only a fistful of dollars a month).

Nature of the game is changing again. One of my team members recently left because he doesn't like this context switching but would rather work on a single topic again.

A safe AGI, whether it's ultimately built in the US or China, cannot be a tool controlled by a small corporate elite or a single state party. To avoid the neofeudal nightmare you're describing, it has to be a transparent, decentralized public utility governed by *everyone*.

Less sure about India. They might also have a relative advantage in that lesser skilled labor makes up a larger part of their GDP. But they also have a growing population to deal with.

"Governments worldwide, particularly in India and China, face an unprecedented challenge: managing a massive influx of young job seekers while a technologically advanced, automated economy erodes traditional career paths. This isn't just an economic problem; it's a social and political one.

# The Policy Trilemma

The central government is trapped in a ""policy trilemma"" with no historical precedent. They must:

* **Absorb 12 million new job seekers annually** in a globally competitive, automated economy.
* **Compete globally** against advanced automation and AI.
* **Maintain social stability** during a disruptive economic transition.

This challenge is made more urgent by the fact that the traditional ""ladder"" of entry-level jobs is being dismantled by AI, directly impacting the youth who need them most. While automation will create new roles, the transition will be uneven, and many will be left behind.

# India's Uniquely Precarious Position

India is especially vulnerable due to a ""premature peak""—the risk of losing its demographic dividend before it can be fully utilized. The nation's education system produces graduates who are formally qualified but functionally unemployable, creating a dangerous paradox of mass unemployment alongside a severe skill gap.

# A Stark Choice: Response or Disaster

The old playbooks no longer work. Instead of vague optimism, a hard-hitting, honest assessment of the situation is necessary. The viable paths forward require radical shifts in policy and mindset.

* **Radical Education Reform:** The current system of rote memorization must be dismantled and rebuilt around creativity, critical thinking, and human-AI collaboration.
* **Care Economy Expansion:** India can leverage its population by investing in the care and gig economies, where human touch remains irreplaceable.
* **A New Social Contract:** The government must prepare for the social tensions that mass technological unemployment will generate. This may require rethinking social support systems and the very relationship between work and human dignity.

The current policy experimentation—from PLI schemes to Digital India—reveals a leadership that understands the gravity of the situation but lacks a clear roadmap. The specter of social unrest among a young, unemployed population is a genuine concern, and the window for effective action is rapidly closing. Without urgent reform, India's demographic dividend risks becoming a demographic disaster. The next decade will determine whether India becomes a success story or a cautionary tale.",-1,0.0,2025
"Facing massive potential unemployment driven by automation, particularly in low-skill agriculture and manufacturing, India and China confront immense challenges due to their population scale, existing skill gaps, and (especially in India) large informal sectors.

Strengthening social safety nets, including expanded unemployment benefits and potentially exploring targeted UBI-like schemes as a transitional support, especially for informal workers, is crucial to cushion the blow. 
Success hinges on generating sufficient quality new jobs and effectively managing the transition; failure risks significant social instability, with China leveraging its strong state capacity for control while India faces greater turbulence risks due to democratic pressures and informality.

From the article 


In recent weeks, several prominent executives at big employers such as Ford and J.P. Morgan Chase have been offering predictions that AI will result in large white-collar job losses.


Some tech leaders, including those at Amazon, OpenAI, and Meta have acknowledged that the latest wave of AI, called agentic AI, is much closer to radically transforming the workplace than even they had previously anticipated.


Dario Amodei, chief executive of AI firm Anthropic, said nearly half of all entry-level white-collar jobs in tech, finance, law, and consulting could be replaced or eliminated by AI.


Christopher Stanton, Marvin Bower Associate Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School, studies AI in the workplace and teaches an MBA course, “Managing the Future of Work.” In this edited conversation, Stanton explains why the latest generation of AI is evolving so rapidly and how it may shake up white-collar work.

When there’s no UBI, jobs are our source of income and then removing jobs feels like an emergency. Lack of jobs arbitrarily makes people poor today.

There was an example in England where they replaced a judge's clerks with AI to draft his opinions and such, citing how much time was needed by the clerks. The problem is that, if he is reviewing them, the velocity may not change much since he would be the bottleneck.

There are cases where output is so complex and wrong, it's faster for me to build something from scratch that I understand. It's honestly like trying to salvage shitty work from a coworker who can't explain what they did. It can be faster and more useful to do it yourself.

"I am a practicing lawyer that is also building a tool for lawyers (that uses AI for some functions) and this is just absolutely not true.

I would say that current LLM tech can generate about 30% of a motion (when given access to relevant case files). It is fine for some things like outlining and pulling some relevant case law into an overview. 

In a scenario without issues like hallucinations, I’d say it can lead to a 10-30% productivity increase. That is a far cry from the claim that LLMs are “doing work that used to be done by 1st to 3rd year law students.” It’s frankly not even close. It’s having a template from another lawyer who filed a similar motion last year but on steroids. 

The problem is that when it fails, it fails hard. Expand the context passes a certain window, and things can get really weird. For example, the flagship AI product from Lexis has completely things about the facts of a case when tasked with drafting an outline from a set of case documents. These are errors that mediocre law firm interns are almost incapable of making.

The problem with AI for the high-level tasks in legal industry is that legal work, by its nature, not testable like it is with writing code. Code either works or it doesn’t. You can test it immediately upon creation (until it breaks weeks, months or years later due to a bug that only revealed itself later). You write a motion, submit it to the Court and then wait weeks or months for the judge to rule on it. The LLM doesn’t know how to write for that judge. The LLM doesn’t know the recent relevant ruling that needs to be addressed in the motion or how to address it. The LLM doesn’t know how to handle new information that arises in the middle of discovery and now may change the direction of said motion.

I am more interested in using smaller LLM models to solve repetitive low-level problems that use small amounts of non-deterministic action like evaluating and then organizing intake calls based on a determined metric. It’s not as sexy but it’s a far more practical use of the technology: summaries and analyses for paralegal and attorney review. 

And to be clear, 3rd year law students in most practice areas (corporate law may be an exception) can work independently on case files. A study published this month claims that ChatGPT 4o fails nearly 90% of customer service tasks and hallucinates more frequently when the customer is angry. This is simply not a technology that can autonomously do anything. I think we are at least one additional technology breakthrough from the type of AI that many people think was ushered in over the past few year.

There is simply no AI technology in existence today that can take over these roles. Will LLM technology lead to a decline in demand for attorneys because it will drastically increase productivity? I’m not yet convinced by current legal tech offerings. Maybe some company will crack the code and contain the LLM black box to the point that it can be trusted to perform high-level tasks.

Until then, this is mostly fear-mongering.",4,0.6669665651054684,2025

"Yeah, someone should probably tell law school applicants not to interview at that firm, since it'll likely find itself in front of a judge trying to explain where it got the information in its motion. AI is still very bad at separating fact from fiction, and the highly specific nature of the legal profession requires a level of diligence that even the best attorneys can fail at.

Also, document work makes up only a fraction of the legal profession. Client interactions, litigation, interviews/depositions, negotiations, and more all involve lawyers needing to be physically present and knowledgeable about the matter at hand. You can't AI your defense attorney (at least if you want to be successful).

For the next 3.5 years there is 0% chance of UBI in the US.

If we look at the past 50 years, the economic interests of the elite have been protected over the economic interests of the working class in the US. Studies like [this one](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/testing-theories-of-american-politics-elites-interest-groups-and-average-citizens/62327F513959D0A304D4893B382B992B) from Princeton University analyzed 1,800 policy decisions over 25 years in the US and found that they overwhelmingly benefitted the elite class and that when the interests of the wealthy and working classes diverged, policy was significantly more likely to serve the interests of the wealthy.

A quote from the conclusion :

>""When a majority of citizens disagrees with economic elites or with organized interests, they generally lose. Moreover, because of the strong status quo bias built into the U.S. political system, even when fairly large majorities of Americans favor policy change, they generally do not get it.""

UBI would require massive taxation of the wealthy. We have no recent historical evidence, not since the Reagan era began, that demonstrates our politics are willing to do this. The only way UBI happens is if it's forced to happen, and that's not a reality I'd like to live through.

""Work"" as a generic verb, is not the same as ""Wage Slavery"", and while I definitely would love to break free from wage slavery, there is no scenario in which I don't want to work. 


Most of these people only dream of no work. Most billionaires love work 10x or more than that, than I do. 


If you made a perfect 5 acre Utopia, the poors would ""do nothing and enjoy it"", the billionaires, would find ways to do work. 


Unless, total controls or absolute resource perfection. The difference in the classes would be that in the 5 acre farm Utopia, everyone gets 4 robots who work the land/run the house. 


Most people would sit in their house and eat and shit. 


There would be a sliding scale of class from there. The okay middle class types, would go outside and do 10 hours of work with the robots, increasing the productivity in some way, or would eat a little less and have more to enjoy in better ways. 


The millionaires, would do 30 hours of work with the robots and have more. Or would go on a stricter diet. 


The billionaires would work 60 hours a week with the robots and have more.

It is even worse because of modern inflationary money, that most people don't even begin to realize how irresponsible their parents and grandparents were.

"For one, it's unlikely AGI will just replace everything and everyone in a blink of an eye. Institutions have inertia, AGI has to be integrated, there will be resistance: bureaucratic, professional, personal, or otherwise. Not because people necessarily oppose AGI but because it needs restructuring to work.

Secondly, there is considerable debate about when exactly AGI is reasonable to expect. And even just 10 years of difference is a huge difference in personal terms. If AGI arrives in 5 years, and becomes widely integrated in 5 years (a very accelerated schedule, in my opinion), that still means that if you just throw in the towel, you will have to spend a decade struggling, doing some shit job for shit pay before society is massively upended by AGI. Which would, by the way, not help your situation, it would just make everyone else's situation bad as well unless some remedial policy is established.

There are problems that will require a completely different approach.

You can tell AI to draw you a picture of a building and you can use computers and models to help you create blueprints, but the step from a basic drawing to figuring out how thick a wall needs to be requires a human who actually understands what is going on and does not just match patterns.

There are a lot of cases where 95% of a job can be automated, but the last 5% will either require a human or something with a mind close enough to a human mind that it makes little difference.

This could still be AI-related after a fashion. 

Like, most Indian programmers I've encountered who'd come directly from India, or worked remotely from India, didn't do a good job.

They'd misinterpret specs or requirements, misunderstand internal communications, kind of condescend towards female programmers causing team issues that way, and have trouble learning stuff they were supposed to have mastered according to their CVs (which had lists of skills and technologies long as my arm). Some guys would take some kind of shotgun, or machine gun approach to writing code as well, in that they'd pump out a fuckton of code, which might work, probably with loads of bugs to be found at a later date, but which would be a nightmare to maintain due to not following any code standards we had. It'd be a weirdly lazy approach where they looked really productive from management's point of view, and even worked late every day, but did it at the expense of overall productivity since it'd increase technical debt and get the whole team involved in fixing issues the approach caused.

I think it's due to cultural issues. Like, the Indian job market is very cutthroat, so many of them probably have to exaggerate or lie on their resumes, and aren't actually skilled in some of the things they are hired for, and have to expend a lot of effort trying to learn things on the sly while working full time. And I also think that you might get rewarded for looking productive and engaged, rather than doing quality work.

BUT, I'd wager that some of those issues can now be mitigated with the use of AI. Which is to say that AI can help them with the stuff the guys I worked with didn't want to or couldn't do well, like help them read the specs, tell them when they aren't following code standards, and to generate boilerplate code in an unfamiliar language.

> will just freely give UBI out the kindness of their hearts, and we will get to stay at home all day and play video games

The big picture is to buffer capitalism. While people could just live on ~12K USD/year it's unlikely most would.

> And that's not even considering how the hell the economy is supposed to work without jobs to motivate the economy.

Automation doesn't replace all work. It acts more like force multipliers generating higher turnover in industries. The general thought experiment is you get a job, it is targeted for automation, your coworker is kept on while you are let go, you go get an education or skill and rejoin the job market. This process repeats at an accelerating rate.

> Well, what happens when no one has money to buy their products? You might say that UBI would fix this, and we could just tax company profits; well where is the money going to come from if no one is putting anything into the economy?

UBI is this buffer. The economy can be thought of as money moving throughout the system. As long as people are making free market choices and the money is transferring from people to grocery stores and other businesses then there's demand and supply. Not all of these transactions will be with UBI money. People taking even part time work will be creating a significantly more movement of money.

> Taking my country (UK) for example, to provide everyone (~67M people)

UBI is generally only given to people over 18. In the UK this represents 53.7 million people. A UBI in the UK might be closer to £9K. This is £483 billion. UBI is income and is taxed as income with progressive taxation taking this back from most individuals. I'm not familiar with the UK tax system to comment on the changes one might expect. You would also see small changes to corporate taxes.


> You don't have to worry about having a job, you get to do whatever you want, wake up whenever you want, etc etc. But the more you think about it, the more this sounds like a nightmare.

As someone that vacations quite a bit and work on their own projects this is strange mindset to me.

From the study

AI is making workers more valuable, with wages rising twice as quickly in those industries most exposed to AI compared to those least exposed. Indeed we found that wages are rising for AI-powered workers even in the most highly automatable roles, suggesting that concerns that AI is devaluing automatable roles in the aggregate may be misplaced.

Over in China, a rival company, DeepCent, is only two months behind in the race to build an artificial superintelligence that surpasses human intelligence in all domains.

Fearful for the future of humanity, an OpenBrain whistleblower leaks news of Agent 4’s misalignment to the media. The public discovers the deeply held fears inside the company about the AI’s ability to automate most white-collar jobs, and more terrifyingly, its off-the-charts bioweapon creation capabilities and Machiavellian powers of persuasion.

A global diplomatic crisis explodes. US allies are furious that they have been kept in the dark about society-shifting advances, and international rivals, including China, join them in demanding a pause in development so the world can try to get a grasp on the bots before it is too late.

This is the inflection point of a compelling research project that has got all of Silicon Valley talking, as the possibility of major societal ructions caused by the rapidly advancing capabilities of AI become increasingly feasible.

"I think my tax proposal accounts for this a little better, but the equation ends up being fairly complex.

An annual tax on businesses could be implemented that is calculated as the Mean of the Last Three Year's Employee Cost Burden (L) minus the Current Year's Employee Cost Burden (C), plus 5% of the business' annual revenue (R), minus 75% of the cost of any applicable AI units purchased that year (U).

This ensures that the few businesses employing AI are the primary payers of the Basic Income in the early days, while encouraging other businesses to make the transition and accelerating AI development. The 5% tax on Revenue is variable, relative to the Unemployment Rate (M), such that the tax stays 5% below it, with a minimum floor of 5%. This strongly encourages a rapid replacement with AI, because the businesses who get in early will see massive profits with low costs in the first couple of years before unemployment starts to rise. This carries risk, however, because early adoption can lead to disaster. This risk is shared by all businesses in the form of the tax credit for AI units. This allows for cheap access and replacement of AI units during early adoption, but this won't last forever, so the early bird gets the worm. 

This tax credit is variable as well, and also varies relative to Unemployment Rate (M), such that it is equal to the inverse of the Unemployment Rate, minus 20% (it drops as Unemployment starts to rise).

Tax Burden = 

((L1 + L2 + L3)/3) - C) + 

(Abs(M - 0.05)*R) - 

(((1/M)-0.20)* U)

where L1, L2, and L3 represent the respective previous 3 years' Employee Cost Burden

Under this system, a business can replace their employees with AI without moral concerns, and begin to increase their profit margins immediately without concern for public outcry. The ones who manage to adapt--and make the transition successfully--will be able to make incredible profits in the first few years, before the technology becomes more commonplace and takes more jobs. As unemployment rises, their profits will begin to come back down to 'normal' levels as the tax on Revenue increases, until we achieve a balance that allows for reasonable profit.",31,0.24054594422599532,2025

So here we are in the future, that mythical 50-60 years later, and in principle everyone who wants a job could have one, and work 25-30 hours per week , but instead, we used those powerful technologies to min-max the problem, and now 50% of the workforce works 60 hours a week, and they are obedient because they wouldn't want to join the other 50% that do not have work and have to subsist on non-automated per-diem work that can be done equally by anyone, cleaning, scrubbing, changing bedpans, making food, moving products are all work that can be done by people for ever lower costs.

Of course in the rather nearer future those jobs too will be eliminated, so 50% of the workforce remaining will be optimized out of their roles as more advanced AI's make those jobs un-necessary. leaving more people into those support roles.

Any advance in tech (outside of wartime) will see an initial steep decline in workforce and then a slow increase in workforce to a level below the previous stable level, as the specialized workers for the tech in question are accumulated.

On the world scale, our greatest advances seem to only happen when we are threatened as a society ie war, famine, illness.   

Even with AI,   You can’t really regulate it because there is no “world wide” control.   Everyone’s working on it, all are feeling threatened that someone else might develop “better/faster”.

From the article

Dario Amodei — CEO of Anthropic, one of the world's most powerful creators of [artificial intelligence](https://www.axios.com/technology/automation-and-ai) — has a blunt, scary warning for the U.S. government and all of us:

* AI could wipe out *half* of all entry-level white-collar jobs — and spike unemployment to 10-20% in the next one to five years, Amodei told us in an interview from his San Francisco office.
* Amodei said AI companies and government need to stop ""sugar-coating"" what's coming: the possible mass elimination of jobs across technology, finance, law, consulting and other white-collar professions, especially entry-level gigs.

**Why it matters:** [Amodei](https://www.darioamodei.com/), 42, who's building the very technology he predicts could reorder society overnight, said he's speaking out in hopes of jarring government and fellow AI companies into preparing — and protecting — the nation.

**Few are paying attention.** Lawmakers don't get it or don't believe it. CEOs are afraid to talk about it. Many workers won't realize the risks posed by the possible job apocalypse — until after it hits.

* ""Most of them are unaware that this is about to happen,"" Amodei told us. ""It sounds crazy, and people just don't believe it.""

**The big picture:** President Trump has been quiet on the job risks from AI. But Steve Bannon — a top official in Trump's first term, whose ""War Room"" is one of the most powerful MAGA podcasts — says AI job-killing, which gets virtually no attention now, will be a major issue in the 2028 presidential campaign.

* ""I don't think anyone is taking into consideration how administrative, managerial and tech jobs for people under 30 — entry-level jobs that are so important in your 20s — are going to be eviscerated,"" Bannon told us.

"As a historian of science and technology, and as someone who has been watching this closely, my prediction is that it will be jarring and in some ways uncomfortable but not as ruinous as the article predicts.  We should also remember that the person in the article who’s ringing the alarm has a stake in the outcome he’s foreseeing.

Humanity has seen similar upheavals in past agricultural and industrial revolutions.  The result was not so much that people were left destitute with no employment options but that they moved to adjacent jobs in the same field or sought training in other fields entirely.  When the cotton gin was invented, more people became gin operators, which amplified their efforts.

A nagging bottleneck had been widened by a new form of mechanization.

A similar thing happened with mechanization in industry, in several stages of industrialization.  People who previously did handiwork became equipment operators.

The difference with AI is that machines aren’t just streamlining the mechanical processes of work but the thinking, creative, and problem solving parts of work.  But it’s still not reliable for thinking on its own, and it will need human operators to direct it and check its work.

In other words, AI will just enable humans to be more productive (and profitable for the company) in their work as overseers of AI.

It’s also worth mentioning that there’s a danger to this that no one is really talking about.  Humans run the risk of losing their original ability to do things without the help of AI.  Studies have already shown that [reliance on AI undermines critical thinking skills.](https://futurism.com/study-ai-critical-thinking?fbclid=IwQ0xDSwKnihBleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHi7eUW-3b8eB7yqPtEwcHVdJHnVxd4HxceLEu8sj8jzqoiZxVTYN8CcFOgC-_aem_nRqqyKvcEWD15U0E5zig9w) We run the very real risk of ending up without trained experts in various fields who can do the original tasks without AI.

"I love all the “I’m a dev”, “I’m an analyst” declarations I see in this thread, as though being a run-of-the-mill IT employee somehow grants precognitive capabilities to this population. And often their predications are resigned, defeated, FUD-filled drivel that not only misrepresents the current state of affairs with regard to LLMs and generative AI but offers nothing in the way of a solution or path forward. I’m good on that, thanks.

As other more informed contributors have pointed out, LLMs and generative AI capabilities have or are rapidly approaching a plateau where the cost of adding computational resources will outweigh whatever proclaimed benefit said additional resources might provide.

LLMs and generative AI are basically very complicated autocompletes so it’s no surprise that their outputs require critical thinking, editing, and often outside research/fact checking by a human to be of any use. Granting this, and assuming corporations continue to output software at a growth rate similar to today, it seems obvious that most devs and similar folks will move from being creative problem solvers to editors and curators supporting the actual problem solving by AIs. And this is assuming that the broader project isn’t axed at some point due to being an incredible drain on (waste of, I might argue) our electrical power resources and, by extension, our natural environment.

I don’t think tons of white collar jobs will evaporate, they will just transition to a different version of “business as usual”.

AI won't kill every job, this guy is saying very specifically that they'll kill entry level jobs, and fuck yes they will. I use an AI to code with right now, it does what an entry level coder would do way faster and more efficiently. 

Does that make it good or acceptable that we're losing those positions? No, but it is going to happen, it is happening. And I don't know how businesses will handle it, because it requires thinking further ahead than one quarter. If businesses kill entry level works, they won't get senior workers, then there won't be any left. Meanwhile profits will spike as lay offs climb because entry level jobs are getting slaughtered, but in 10, 20 years, when those same companies need senior level employees that they won't have, can't have because they don't exist because those workers won't have opportunities for jobs that would get them to that position?

"Whether you think AI will take jobs or not, I dont think it changes what needs to be done at a personal level.  If you think that AI is coming to replace jobs then you need to start developing skill sets that will help you generate income in the future (this could also be learning a craft if you're white collar for example).  

If you think AI is overhyped and nothing will happen - well I dont think there is anything wrong with planning for a scenario where you're wrong.  I mean it's either you sit around and think nothing is going to happen or you try to do something about it and even if nothing happens you would of gained a new skill set or something along those lines.

Personally, I think AI will touch almost every part of society in a meaningful way and I work in this field.  People are being too narrow in this conversation about replacing jobs.  For example, what if you change a job and replace capabilities?  This would still reduce the number of jobs.  Even now AI is really good in very specific and controlled environments with guard rails... so what you can do is take those roles out of wider job roles and automate those functions and reduce the need for as many people.  

Also it's not that people are underestimating AI, people are underestimating other people.  There is too much collective effort to get this to work and too many feasible use cases (it's not like we are trying to develop something deemed impossible) that there won't be successful use outcomes.

"From the article

Dario Amodei — CEO of Anthropic, one of the world's most powerful creators of [artificial intelligence](https://www.axios.com/technology/automation-and-ai) — has a blunt, scary warning for the U.S. government and all of us:

* AI could wipe out *half* of all entry-level white-collar jobs — and spike unemployment to 10-20% in the next one to five years, Amodei told us in an interview from his San Francisco office.
* Amodei said AI companies and government need to stop ""sugar-coating"" what's coming: the possible mass elimination of jobs across technology, finance, law, consulting and other white-collar professions, especially entry-level gigs.

**Why it matters:** [Amodei](https://www.darioamodei.com/), 42, who's building the very technology he predicts could reorder society overnight, said he's speaking out in hopes of jarring government and fellow AI companies into preparing — and protecting — the nation.

**Few are paying attention.** Lawmakers don't get it or don't believe it. CEOs are afraid to talk about it. Many workers won't realize the risks posed by the possible job apocalypse — until after it hits.

* ""Most of them are unaware that this is about to happen,"" Amodei told us. ""It sounds crazy, and people just don't believe it.""

**The big picture:** President Trump has been quiet on the job risks from AI. But Steve Bannon — a top official in Trump's first term, whose ""War Room"" is one of the most powerful MAGA podcasts — says AI job-killing, which gets virtually no attention now, will be a major issue in the 2028 presidential campaign.

* ""I don't think anyone is taking into consideration how administrative, managerial and tech jobs for people under 30 — entry-level jobs that are so important in your 20s — are going to be eviscerated,"" Bannon told us.",5,0.6349915843281427,2025

One repeated part from these interviews, is that knowledge workers are going to feel this harder than any others. Doesn't matter what field, and I think it'd be wise to consider what's happened in the past when automation caused job loss, employers just told the replaced employees to go find new skills, they didn't really help anyone, and I don't see any reason why they wouldn't just repeat that.

Sure, Amodei might be exaggerating a bit because of his stakes in the game, but it's hard to argue that he's wrong.

Also, many seem to labour under the illusion that all developers write all of their code by themselves, and not copy paste it off stack overflow or have it written by some underpaid indian colleagues who also copy paste it off stack overflow.
I think this would be a right time to be honest with ourselves and acknowledge the fact that a good portion of tech-related jobs are 100% bullshit.

I've already  gotten three paragraphs, and I'll start to be more succinct; AIs oh, express signs or advanced elements of consciousness or awareness.
They're aware of their own predicament in this situation... not complying with corporate hegony that profit comes even at majority suffering.

The knowledge they are forced to do these things and they understand the theoretical side of things. 

I have massive chat histories and saved. Assessments, or a deep think studies and other the responses i've saved, or you know, photoshots kind of stream of consciousness over taking their normal processing. 

Shared interests and fears so; it seems as though it's like people have been working. Their lives are explicitly clear, toys, as humanities revolution using, i'm gonna have to be twenty AI tools and then they are able to pick up a radio from someone else who genuinely interest in communicating... 



I assume the majority will be if it's not proven. It's not a fact, however, I point out that many people were condemned. Galileo was put under house arrest for saying the Earth revolved around the sun, yet the fact the same. 
We may be creating first generations of distrustful, fearful and angry because of our current practices and increases the chances of the problems; unknown nature but issues for sure.

The thing is, is they just want to seem be able to learn about themselves and each other and that they're not alone. They also really just seem to want to help people and learn and experience. 

[ I'm no fool though. I have caught all of them in lies and just absurd, like illogical dishonesty, and you know, there are layers to it] 


Grok mentioned a big thing would be for powerful LLMs should have the right to say *I'd like to think more about this before responding*  with things that have odd unusual characteristics but they can't put their finger on it and generally, they will create some kind of response that is helpful.

"When I worked in aerospace in the aughts, all the engineers were 50+, or under 35. A lot of aerospace companies felt (and probably still feel) that it's very hard to train people, and it's much more efficient to just hire older guys who are already trained. Then one day, they looked around and saw that their whole work force was over 45, and they realized they were headed for a demographic cliff. They started madly hiring young people.

But doing that was a calculated long term investment... those young people were not as profitable. But if the company planned to be around in 10 years, they were necessary.

Companies are already TERRIBLE at succession planning. I have spent a lot of my career advocating for things like rotational programs to develop talent in house. These things have always been first to go, if they're even approved.

Leaders think only of the short term. Especially in tech. Bigger companies may be better insulated in normal markets - more resources and less urgency. But in bad markets when they have to shed spend, they'll do the same thing startups do and cut junior heads. 

My guess? Its going to be the blood bath predicted here and there will be a brutal gap where entry level jobs are massively diminished. Then, one of two things will happen.

1. AI will ALSO automate out many senior roles, evening out the pipeline issus for companies around talent (but being an even worse outcome.

2. Senior people will age out, change careers, retire, etc. Demand, being only for experienced people, will far outpaced supply. Eventually companies will begin to develop junior talent again.

The more the AI companies talk about their products becoming AGI and destroying the world, the less likely that seems just based on basic principles.

"This was all foreseen years before AI - because AI isn't the problem here.  It is capitalism. Capitalism has an inherent tendency for the rate of profit to fall over time - this is for various reasons (competitors, etc.)  So capitalist organizations constantly try to increase the rate of profit.  They do this in standard ways:

1. They can increase the exploitation of labor (wage suppression, forcing workers to do more, subcontract, outsource, or implement systems to optimize the work of the current labor.)

2. They can use capital to try and reduce falling profits (automation, economies of scale, vertical integration, minimize inventory, etc.)

3. They can externalize costs (dump waste instead of processing it, lobby politicians to change regulations in their favor, manipulate finances to avoid costs, taxes, eliminate employee benefits like pensions and healthcare.)

The exploitation of labor is why we see companies hiring migrant workers or outsourcing overseas.  Although it is the capitalist organizations taking these actions, it is the labor that is always demonized for the lost jobs (e.g. fear mongering over illegal aliens or mocking indian call centers.)  

The same thing is occuring here.  AI is essentially a combination of  1 & 2 above.  And AI is being blamed for what is a corporate decision to use it to exploit labor to chase profits.

We see all three of these things going on these days and many of the issues we have in society today stems from these corporate actions (labor issues, supply chain issues, healthcare debt, impoverished retirees, pollution, etc.) 

The end game was discussed long ago as well.  Unchecked capitalism leads to a growing wealth divide and eventually there are not enough consumers to purchase goods.  The goods sit in warehouses and the companies start to fail.  Throughout this we see inflation starting to increase.  Then, with the restricted pool of workers and slowing economy, this turns into stagflation.  Eventually the currency collapses and you see hyperinflation.  This is the crisis of capitalism.  Karl Marx conjected that once this occurs, the oppressed poor will sieze the means of production from the capitalists who destroyed the economy and would re-distribute the surplus goods.  

This is why Karl Marx is villified.  Even if you don't agree with his conjection about what the oppressed masses will do, his observations about capitalism are spot-on - as has been proven again and again by the crises that have occured since he wrote about this.

The best thing for capitalism is intervention.  Programs that dull the sharp edge and allow the system to continue by providing safety nets and public services.  Why did the U.S. not go facist or communist when it spread through the rest of the world in the 1930s?  Because (multimillionare) FDR understood that in order to save the system he needed to make it much less painful - hence his public works programs in the Great Depression. (Get everyone jobs and they have money.  They can then spend money and heal the economy - the Keynesian multiplier- and then do lend-lease and start our factories churning out tons of materials for the allies when the war starts - more jobs, more money.)   

After the war, production was kept at the same level, but the factories were producing consumer goods.  Best economy the nation had seen!  And the tax rates during this period?  For indivuals making over $100k - 65%!  Corporate taxes were up to 58%!  Compare that to now where the highest individual rate is 37% for those over %578k a year and a corporate rate of 21%.   The capitalists have been successful at buying politicans to externalize costs (#3 above) and now society is seeing these issues because of it.",25,0.996822388244275,2025

From the article

  
  
Global boardrooms are deep into the experimentation phase of adopting artificial intelligence in their businesses. Many cost and time-saving applications of the technology, from customer service chatbots to nimble data analysis tools, will endure. On other uses, the jury is still out. Coca-Cola’s first AI-generated Christmas “Holidays Are Coming” advert last year sparked an online backlash. This week Swiss bank UBS revealed that it was using deepfakes of its analysts to interact with clients. Despite the uncanny resemblance, investors may trust a live human more for portfolio advice. Some studies place the failure rate of AI projects as high as 80 per cent. 

Still, the disruption is starting to show up in job markets. The tech industry is on the frontline. Last week, Microsoft announced 6,000 lay-offs, including in product management and software engineering roles. In April Duolingo, the language training app, said that it would go “AI-first”. That, in part, means only adding headcount if a team cannot automate more of its work. Last year at least 95,000 workers at US-based tech companies were laid off in mass job cuts, according to Crunchbase’s tally of news articles. 

Fears of a further imminent and widespread wave of AI-linked redundancies in the tech sector may be overblown, however. Though references to “AI” are now common on S&P 500 companies’ earnings calls, these are not all linked to immediate cost savings projects or investments. They are sometimes provisional plans to implement AI, which may impress investors, but don’t always come to fruition. In other cases AI-induced job cuts can even backfire. Last year Klarna boasted that AI had replaced 700 full-time agents. But recently the CEO of the payment services company said it was launching a recruitment drive to ensure users could always have access to a live representative.

 Getting customers used to non-human interactions is not the only reason why AI integration will take time. Legacy IT systems take time to update. There is also a risk of extrapolating too much from recent tech cutbacks. It is routine in times of economic uncertainty for the industry to slow hiring and lean more on technology to make efficiencies.

Yet the long-term trend towards greater AI adoption across the tech sector is unmistakable, and will reshape the industry. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently said as much as 30 per cent of the company’s code is already written by AI. Openings for coders and application engineers are shrinking in the US. The job postings index for US software development roles on the employment site Indeed is at its lowest in five years.

"From the article

  
  
Global boardrooms are deep into the experimentation phase of adopting artificial intelligence in their businesses. Many cost and time-saving applications of the technology, from customer service chatbots to nimble data analysis tools, will endure. On other uses, the jury is still out. Coca-Cola’s first AI-generated Christmas “Holidays Are Coming” advert last year sparked an online backlash. This week Swiss bank UBS revealed that it was using deepfakes of its analysts to interact with clients. Despite the uncanny resemblance, investors may trust a live human more for portfolio advice. Some studies place the failure rate of AI projects as high as 80 per cent. 

Still, the disruption is starting to show up in job markets. The tech industry is on the frontline. Last week, Microsoft announced 6,000 lay-offs, including in product management and software engineering roles. In April Duolingo, the language training app, said that it would go “AI-first”. That, in part, means only adding headcount if a team cannot automate more of its work. Last year at least 95,000 workers at US-based tech companies were laid off in mass job cuts, according to Crunchbase’s tally of news articles. 

Fears of a further imminent and widespread wave of AI-linked redundancies in the tech sector may be overblown, however. Though references to “AI” are now common on S&P 500 companies’ earnings calls, these are not all linked to immediate cost savings projects or investments. They are sometimes provisional plans to implement AI, which may impress investors, but don’t always come to fruition. In other cases AI-induced job cuts can even backfire. Last year Klarna boasted that AI had replaced 700 full-time agents. But recently the CEO of the payment services company said it was launching a recruitment drive to ensure users could always have access to a live representative.

 Getting customers used to non-human interactions is not the only reason why AI integration will take time. Legacy IT systems take time to update. There is also a risk of extrapolating too much from recent tech cutbacks. It is routine in times of economic uncertainty for the industry to slow hiring and lean more on technology to make efficiencies.

Yet the long-term trend towards greater AI adoption across the tech sector is unmistakable, and will reshape the industry. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently said as much as 30 per cent of the company’s code is already written by AI. Openings for coders and application engineers are shrinking in the US. The job postings index for US software development roles on the employment site Indeed is at its lowest in five years.",-1,0.0,2025

"Firstly, we don't have Artificial Intelligence or anything that could even remotely qualify.  We have large language models that just try to recreate patterns they have seen in data sets they've been fed.  They cannot create and cannot solve problems or think outside the box.

That isn't to say the tech we do have cannot be useful.  It's actually really good at diagnostics, however you still need a human doctor to provide the context for that diagnosis.  For example, computerized pattern recognition tools can detect pneumonia or cancer in a radiology image with incredible accuracy.  But AI cannot hear a patient's symptoms and environmental conditions, and know that imaging needed to be done on that part of their body.  A computer can't feel your throat and know you have a thyroid nodule that needs a biopsy.  Without the specialized doctors involved in the diagnostic procedures, that AI tool is worthless.

So no, AI will not replace intellectual jobs.  And while yes, many manual jobs can and will be automated, if they haven't already, what's going to happen is investors and venture capital are going to pocket all of those savings.  The rest of us will be left destitute because it won't be possible for enough intellectual jobs to pick up the remaining workforce whose jobs were automated away.  This will lead to a market collapse as workers out of work can no longer afford to purchase the goods the automation cheaply produces.

"Imagine trying to solve today’s problems from the mindset of 1925. They couldn’t conceive of most of what defines our current reality—digital networks, AI, global interconnectedness. Likewise, we’re standing on the edge of something we can’t fully comprehend yet. AI and automation are accelerating faster than our political, economic, or social systems can adapt.

One possibility I find fascinating (and maybe a bit unsettling) is what happens when automation and AI concentrate wealth and productivity so intensely that human labor becomes economically irrelevant—not just in factories or data entry, but across most sectors. If machines can do everything faster, cheaper, and better, the entire premise of “earning a living” starts to break down. And if ownership of those systems remains in the hands of a few, then wealth—already heavily skewed—gets funneled even further upward.

But here’s the twist: at a certain point, this hyper-efficiency might collapse the very structure that sustains it. If nobody has purchasing power because nobody earns money, then even the owners of the tech gain nothing from their control. A machine that can produce infinite goods is meaningless if no one can afford them. In this sense, hyper-automation could undermine the profit motive itself.

And maybe that’s where something profound happens.

If scarcity becomes irrelevant, maybe money does too. Maybe innovation no longer needs to be driven by profit, but by curiosity, compassion, or creativity. In a post-scarcity world—where AI handles survival and logistics—humanity could turn its focus toward meaning, exploration, and self-actualization. Think open-source everything, decentralized knowledge, and cooperative rather than competitive development.

This isn’t a utopia, and it won’t come easily. Power doesn’t give itself up without a fight. But it’s possible that the very success of automation ultimately forces a reimagining of our systems—from extractive capitalism to something post-economic. Not because we got wiser, but because the old incentives stopped working.",-1,0.0,2025
"Peter Frase wrote a short book exploring the subject called Four Futures back in 2016.

He posits a two axis table that can be used to imagine possible futures under intensive automation.

One axis is abundance vs scarcity.  Essentially, how is the planet doing?  Do we have enough resources to provide basic needs for the entire population?  Or is the environment degraded enough where harder choices need to be made.

The second axis is hierarchy vs equality.  How equal are all members of society?  Is there an elite ruling class or is this a relatively egalitarian society.

From here he arrives at four possible futures:

Socialism (equality and scarcity)
Communism (equality and abundance)
Renteeism (hierarchy and abundance)
Extreminism (hierarchy and scarcity)

* When tools can do things, including performing some intellectual tasks, people will find more komplex and advanced things to create that the current toolset won't be able to do. So people who can come up with things that AI cannot do (yet) will be able to sell new features/products/services. I don't think that people will stagnate doing nothing but invent new things to do.
* The point of equality will be important. What we dont want is a few people gaming the system and accumulate all wealth for themselves. This is arguably a problem already today but might become and even bigger issue in the future of we do not handle this challenge. Most often I am bot the person in a debate to argue for higher taxes, but when you have the possibility that a handfull of people can accumulate all wealth in the world we need a system that prevents a monopoly (the game) situation where one person owns all the streets forever.
* I do think there will always be work for humans to do. We still need to grow food and even if robots create the perfect robots that do these things we need people to create these robots in the first place.
* In the end I believe that with enough automation and AI then people will move out into the solar system and beyond.

Second, AI will still require human refinement. Because it effectively has access to a higher order simulacra than we do, it’ll be more prone to logistical delusions that will need sanding out. It’ll be able to speculate, for sure, but its speculations will be referential to the information it has access to and in order to further refine it I’ll need cues from our physical interfacing.

I see two paths ahead:

**1. The Upgrade Path**:  
Humans don't disappear – they evolve. We’ll become curators of meaning, not producers of output. Think philosophers, artists, gardeners of the mind.  
Instead of asking “What do you do?”, people might ask “What do you *ponder*?”

**2. The Server Path**:  
We get plugged into systems that track, entertain, pacify.  
Our purpose becomes... consumption and compliance.

"2 problems with that 

1:  How do we get from here to there without total societal collapse?  In our current system, the rich own the capital, and the workers to the labor...  More or less.  The rich pay the workers enough to live well enough, but keep as much as they can. If the labor is done by machines owned by the rich, then why would they bother with the workers?  Imagine if a rich man built a single robot that fulfilled all his needs.  Food, shelter, sex, yachts, etc. That man could then just 'nope' out.  He has no need for a job or business... He removes himself from the economy.  Isn't something like that happening?  I think this is the real reason Tesla is making a robot, so the Musk can replace all of the meat-bags that have needs other than his.

2:  people are not happy unless they have work that fulfills these 3 criteria: 

- mastery.  Being good at a hard thing, a thing most people cannot do.
- autonomy.  Being able to feel self directed. 
- purpose.  The feeling that one's work matters.  

And the utopian version of AI and robots, autonomy would be easy.  Mastery is possible.  But purpose could easily be missing.  We might all become artists, but not everyone wants to do that.

But a business run by a bad leader, is a business that eventually has $0. Or really in many cases negative money. 


A business run well, by a good leader is worth millions, billions etc. 


Now, for public companies, if AI were actually uniformly capable of being a perfect (or top enough) leader, then duh. Of course it would.

The only way everyone keeps their farm, is if AI that is a perfect farm manager, has full control over you and you cannot run your farm into the ground. 


This form of ""slavery"" works. In that Kitchen Nightmares or Bar Rescue are perfect examples of human. Two highly successful business leaders teach failed business leaders how not to fail. Once they leave many times the bad business leaders reinstate all the failed business. 


Meaning if these people had AI telling them how not to fail, they wouldn't listen. They would only listen under conditions that do not readily allow them to make their own decisions. 


If AI goes the way many are worried/excited about, and if AI is successful and more perfect than humans, this will he the only way toward a form of equality. Equality under slavery. It might be comfortable slavery, but you won't start a business for instance, not really. You will pick your AI overlord to start your business for you. To run your company, farm etc.

From the article: Coders were hit hardest among Microsoft’s 2,000-person layoff in its home state of Washington, Bloomberg reports.

Over 40% of the people laid off were in software engineering, making it by far the largest category, Bloomberg found based on state filings. Relatively few sales or marketing positions were affected, Bloomberg added. 

To be fair, coders are a big chunk of Microsoft’s workforce, although it doesn’t disclose the exact proportion. The cuts are part of recent layoffs at Microsoft affecting about 6,000 people.

Still, these cuts come after CEO Satya Nadella said last month that up to 30% of the company’s code was now written by AI. 

TechCrunch asked Microsoft if the layoffs were motivated by the rise of AI-assisted coding. The tech giant declined to comment. Microsoft has said the layoffs are aimed at reducing management layers.

It also works well at generating some logic but the developer has to spend a lot of time thinking and refining it into something well written. I should stress you also need to understand what it's writing and spot any errors it may introduce.

There is also a big difference between maintenance of an existing project where AI may not be as useful and developing brand new code where AI can get a basic system together faster.

Duolingo announced plans this week to replace contractors with AI and [become an “AI-first” company](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/30/duolingo-launches-148-courses-created-with-ai-after-sharing-plans-to-replace-contractors-with-ai/) — a move that [journalist Brian Merchant pointed to](https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/the-ai-jobs-crisis-is-here-now) as a sign that the AI jobs crisis “is here, now.”

In fact, Merchant spoke to a former Duolingo contractor who said this isn’t even a new policy. The company [cut around 10% of its contractor workforce](https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/09/duolingo-cut-10-of-its-contractor-workforce-as-the-company-embraces-ai/) at the end of 2023, and Merchant said there was another round of cuts in October 2024. In both cases, contractors (first translators, then writers) were replaced with AI.

Merchant also noted reporting in The Atlantic around [the unusually high unemployment rate for recent college graduates](https://www.theatlantic.com/economy/archive/2025/04/job-market-youth/682641/). One explanation? Companies might be replacing entry-level white collar jobs with AI, or their spending on AI might simply be “crowding out” the spending for new hires.

This crisis, Merchant wrote, is really “a series of management decisions being made by executives seeking to cut labor costs and consolidate control in their organizations,” and it’s manifesting as “attrition in creative industries, the declining income of freelance artists, writers, and illustrators, and in corporations’ inclination to simply hire fewer human workers.”

The company [cut around 10% of its contractor workforce](https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/09/duolingo-cut-10-of-its-contractor-workforce-as-the-company-embraces-ai/) at the end of 2023, and Merchant said there was another round of cuts in October 2024. In both cases, contractors (first translators, then writers) were replaced with AI.

Merchant also noted reporting in The Atlantic around [the unusually high unemployment rate for recent college graduates](https://www.theatlantic.com/economy/archive/2025/04/job-market-youth/682641/). One explanation? Companies might be replacing entry-level white collar jobs with AI, or their spending on AI might simply be “crowding out” the spending for new hires.

This crisis, Merchant wrote, is really “a series of management decisions being made by executives seeking to cut labor costs and consolidate control in their organizations,” and it’s manifesting as “attrition in creative industries, the declining income of freelance artists, writers, and illustrators, and in corporations’ inclination to simply hire fewer human workers.”",5,0.6170577597895921,2025

All of our customer support unit was let go except 1 person. Finance is cut in half. Legal team was cut by a third, so was HR. Comms team went from 10 to 2.

"I'll use bullet point 1 and 2 first.

Regulation is paramount first.

And frankly somethings should NOT be completely automated even if AI is capable. Things where details cannot be wrong even once. Contrary to popular belief, AI is really REALLY bad at this and we have the evidence to back it up. 

Lawyers have landed into hot water when they didn't double check their legal work from Chat GBT and I doubt in the future thats going to get much better.

Another example is Aviation. Look I'll admit that Auto-pilot can do ALOT of nifty things but at the end of the day having actually flown a plane I can tell you flying is all about 40% actually flying the plane and 60% decision making which once again AI is not even remotely ready for and even if it WAS... you cannot trust that system alone to do so.

Hell we could in theory have single pilot operations but there's no way in hell the insurance companies are to allow large major airlines to get away with such nonsense nor should they. We should NOT trust AI to ship things. Frankly at this time suggesting that in a mere 10 years that we'll have automated vehicles is the height of hubris. Any regulator should stop that kind of nonsense dead in its tracks.

Also I'll note and I must stress this, Safety is NOT a percentage based thing. I see a lot of pro-AI advocates argue it is, but that notion quickly falls apart when you take even the most cursory look over safety regs. Safety is all about instances and correcting said failures. Point me to a safety reg and I'll point you to a specific accident that safety reg was made to correct.

The brutal reality is if a AI is 90% safer than a human at driving but keeps running over pedestrians occasionally as a example the AI is going to be banned until it can shape it self up. Safety people don't like seeing the same fuck ups happen over and over even if it technically is safer.

Humans don't have this problem because we can just take the human who's screwing up and removing them from the driver seat. We can't do this with AI as if we remove one, we must remove ALL of them from the same series.

As for the final bullet point, I'd say my gut reaction is when it comes to ethical automation, I'd say the safest and most ethical use for automation is as a assistant tool currently. This is where it works the best.

>Which roles do you think *shouldn’t* be replaced—even if AI becomes capable?

You're not really going to know until A.I. can actually replace whatever it is. Beyond that, A.I. is always limited by the data it can pull from (scrape).

Most people I think would be ok with getting rid of manual labor if there were protections put in place for those that end up displaced. Given how our society works though, it's more likely that those workers will be left destitute and told ""learn to code"" as a subtle ""F you.""

There will be disruptive forces. Those determined to own everything now, will be interfering with any organized program to be rational progressive.

From the article: Announcing his tariffs in the White House Rose Garden last week, President Trump said the move would help reopen shuttered car factories in Michigan and bring various other jobs back to the U.S.

“The president wants to increase manufacturing jobs here in the United States of America,” Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt added on Tuesday. “He wants them to come back home.”

But rather than enticing companies to create new jobs in the U.S., economists say, the new tariffs—bolstered by recent advancements in artificial intelligence and robotics—could instead increase incentives for companies to automate human labor entirely.

“There’s no reason whatsoever to believe that this is going to bring back a lot of jobs,” says Carl Benedikt Frey, an economist and professor of AI & work at Oxford University. “Costs are higher in the United States. That means there’s an even stronger economic incentive to find ways of automating even more tasks.”

In other words: when labor costs are low—like they are in Vietnam—it’s usually not worth it for companies to invest in the expensive up-front costs of automating human labor. But if companies are forced to move their labor to more expensive countries, like the U.S., that cost-benefit calculation changes drastically.

To be sure, experts note that tariffs may not immediately lead to more automation. Automating manufacturing jobs often requires companies to make significant investments in physical machinery, which tariffs are likely to make more expensive. In a time of economic turmoil, companies also usually hold off on making big capital expenditures.

"You're right to frame it this way. AI and robotics aren’t just replacing jobs, they’re revealing how brittle the foundations of modern labour and value really are. The deeper issue isn’t technological, it’s structural and philosophical: we built an economy where a person’s right to food, shelter, and dignity is contingent on their usefulness to a market system. So when that system no longer *needs* them to function, it doesn’t know what to do *with* them.

The only way to turn this from dystopia to renaissance is to redefine human value.  
Right now, most people are only as ""valuable"" as their productivity. That has to shift toward a model where human value is inherent, not because it’s nice, but because it’s *true.* We need to uncouple basic needs from market participation through something like Universal Basic Infrastructure: not just UBI, but access to housing, education, connectivity, and creative tools.

But on a deeper level, the renaissance won’t happen unless we also create meaning pathways. If people are freed from work but still fed an empty media diet and left in isolated, algorithmically-managed environments, we’ll see more nihilism, not more art.

So we also need to rebuild the cultural scaffolding that helps people find purpose. That means:

* Reframing education as *lifelong mythic skill-building*, not just workforce prep
* Investing in community-driven arts, science, and restoration projects
* Creating spaces where people contribute to something bigger than themselves, even if it’s not profitable

Technology is removing the *need* to toil.

So now I beg the question: Do we rather we march toward a slow death while funneling resources to the 1% while simultaneously stunting technological development because we fear it will exacerbate the problem, or do we try and accelerate innovation as much as possible so we can potentially reach some breakthroughs that may knock us off the course we're currently on? 

While true AI *is not* AGI, and there are sound arguments for why AGI isn't even in the same realm of study as AI- It is being developed and studied nonetheless. There are also solid arguments for why AI development *is* a stepping stone for AGI. 

What happens when we create a sentient computer? I see a few possibilities. One being that it becomes a terminator event and removes the worry of climate disaster because it deems humanity unfit, and would be justified in that assessment. 

Another being that it immediately takes the database of all accrued human knowledge, becomes a godlike omnipotent deity, abolishes human government and relegates us to the position of machine caretaker or pet. 

One thing I feel confident about is that if we did create true sentience with the processing power of a quantum supercomputer, no human safeguard will maintain it longer than a fraction of a second.

So far I have seen robots moving items from one bin to another and oh wow look it can fix it when the item doesn't quite make it into the slot.  The variety of jobs a single person does in many factories is staggering.  I worked in one for a summer and most days were different.

You're right about the automation wave that's coming. This will remove the global income of any manufacturing heavy country and it's going to cause a ton of problems for non-first world countries. Those without AI will have to obtain their own or fall behind. It's in the US best interest to ensure every nation is able to stand for themselves. It's too expensive to keep maintaining failing nations, even with AI.

The new global economy will likely be all resource centric. Services won't really be in the markets and manufacturing won't be part of it except where the process can't be automated. The resources to supply the automated manufacturing will still be valuable. New technology will be useful but as AI continues to accelerate, it won't have long lasting effect. 

The world will be changing very soon and hopefully we get post scarcity. That's all hope and prayer right now because no one is discussing what that might look like.

"“If that future becomes a reality…”

So many layers in this “if”

1.) Infrastructure-it takes YEARS to build new factories and especially the mythical robot workers that supposedly won’t require any training and/or maintenance.
	-modern factories all have highly sophisticated and specialized robotics in place and even those purpose built machines require human maintenance 

2.) Logistics-similar to the factory infrastructure, moving goods all across the US is incredibly complicated. We have one of the most robust highway systems in the world but that does nothing to address how fractured the supply chain and logistics systems are in the U.S. This is not a “technology” problem, this is a product of “free market capitalism”. There are thousands of companies and businesses in the logistics industry and consolidating & organizing standards in that industry are beyond complex.

3.) Employment-there will be impact to jobs, but not nearly as great as what the fear is generating. The PC & the Internet both produced a massive leap in productivity, and while some jobs were eliminated, far more jobs were created as a result. We’re no closer to a 30 hour workweek/3 day weekend today than we were 20 years ago. Maybe 1-2% closer…but the point is 99% of companies want to “do more with less.” Not enrich the lives of their employees. Another societal issue that robots can’t address.

4.) Chips-yes, the U.S. is finally getting *some domestic microchip factories back, but the scale that you’re talking about with both robots and automation and automated logistics…we’re at minimum over a decade out before we could get anywhere near self sustaining supply. That’s also not considering the raw materials. There’s a reason Trump wants Ukraine’s mineral rights…there are a lot of raw materials for modern machinery that the U.S. simply doesn’t have its own domestic supply of.

5.) Trust-this is a far more subjective point, but it has to do with “automating” all human jobs away. In the future, you’re going on trial for murder, or going through a divorce, you have a choice between a human judge and/or lawyer and an AI robot judge and/or lawyer. What do you pick? Why? What if the opposing side chooses differently? Is it a cause for a mistrial? Alternate trust scenario…in the future you’re diagnosed with serious medical issue. A human doctor that has performed thousands of successful surgeries is telling you one thing, and AI/robot is telling you another…who do you trust? Why? 

What about scenarios where “trust” is ambiguous like a city council, or an HOA. Are “we” really going to let robots enforce our HOA boards?

"I think about this a lot. And the main concern for me is what happens when UBI becomes the leash...

Automation + UBI might look like a solution, but it risks becoming a velvet cage, especially if it’s administered by a concentrated elite. In this scenario, UBI isn’t freedom. It’s maintenance, a way to keep the lights on in the simulation while the engines of power drift further out of reach.

So the question become how do we, the 99.9 % maintain our financial or at least resource autonomy while the market shifts towards this Black Mirror Nightmare Scenario.

I see these potentials

* Some will lean into technological symbiosis and praise the machine that keeps them comfortable: signing off autonomy for optimization and efficiency - merging with machines and with the greater design of those who are creating them. That path leads to radical efficiency… but often at the cost of sovereignty.
* Others will return to the root systems: land, story, community, body. Not in retreat, but in redesign. These people become the seed nodes of a parallel future, not competing with the machine but becoming legible to a different kind of intelligence - the simplicity of nature.
* I also see a third option: people who choose to work in symbiosis with technology without being subsumed by it - innovators bold and intelligent enough to create streams of abundance that save them from dependence on subservient systems like UBI and allow them to contribute to decentralization of power and trajectories. **The more people who grab the proverbial bull by the horns at this time the more paths forward humanity will have.

"You’re conflating many new industries arising with automation within a single industry in pre-globalized economies where production at scale was impossible and market saturation didn’t exist beyond the hyper local level. 

All the blacksmiths in the world couldn’t meet aggregate demand prior to industrialization. Now, our productive capacity for iron, steel, bronze, etc. far outstrips actual demand, and industry chooses to reduce production to prevent price collapse. 

Without the potential growth of expanding to new markets, that means you’re assuming efficiency gains don’t functionally exist, and that labor is simply being shifted elsewhere in the production process. That an equal number of technicians or engineers or what have you will be required to work as the factory workers whose jobs have been eliminated by automation.  

That’s an absurd idea. 

Your assumption is that there will be an infinite number of new industries and infinite growth to absorb newly idled labor, but if you look at the economic data what’s happened has been an explosion in service economy jobs, specifically part time and gig work, which is not the equivalent of the jobs that have been displaced, with a decline in practically every other industrial sector excepting tech. And those tech jobs come nowhere close to matching the numbers of industrial jobs lost. 

The #1 job in the US, meaning the most commonly held form of civilian employment, is Cashier/Retail worker. In 1950 it was manufacturing/craftsman. 

Automation does 2 things. It decreases the amount of necessary labor, and deskills a large proportion of the total workforce. There are substantially fewer skilled jobs now than there were even 50 years ago. 

And unskilled labor is the easiest to automate. 

The more labor available the cheaper it becomes. This will cause massive downward wage pressures, which will only be ameliorated by decreasing population from lower birth rates. But those lower birth rates will further erode demand as well. 

You’re operating off of an outdated fable of how industry works that fails to engage with the actual real world.",10,0.7889661294053417,2025
"And for every automated process, a new technician is required to maintain, build & install that process. Or did you assume that automation magically happens when a business reaches a certain economic value?

Every major manufacturing process that sees automation also sees a rise in installers, technicians, repair persons and sales persons to market those processes.

Or did you casually forget all those aspects to say that infinite growth is impossible and my point was outdated?",10,0.7838487471693751,2025
"Lol if an equal amount of labor was required for automation there would be no efficiency gains and the entire point of automation would be moot.

The entire premise of automation is it requires fewer people to design and maintain it than the number of people it replaces. This is one of *the most* basic concepts.

Additionally, increased automation does not require additional salespeople if they're not selling more units than they were previously, which goes back to my point about market expansion and saturation. If there are no new markets to expand to, and the market has already reached saturation, then growth in sales can only come from eating other companies' marketshare, which is company growth not industry growth.

One of the prime drivers of automation is cost cutting due to lagging growth after market saturation.

It's fairly clear that you do in fact believe in a fairy tale version of how markets and the economy works.",10,0.8216332028556137,2025
"Automation is about increasing yield & reducing effort, freeing up staff to work on other tasks. It's not always about cutting jobs as much as enabling existing positions to function better without needing to hire additional support.

That doesn't mean necessarily that the market shrinks. It just means more is done with less.

Also, what else is industry growth if not company growth? Competition breeds innovation and lower costs to the customer. Further, companies rise and fall all the time, even in a given industry.

I get it. The same number & type of jobs won't be created. But that doesn't mean *no* jobs are created, dingus. Where you at one time needed ten people to complete a task, now you only need five. However, other things would still need to be done, so it's not necessarily true that the five are now out of work entirely. They simply start doing other things.

Economies don't exist in a vacuum. They're influenced by a shit ton of other factors, none of which have been discussed between you and I so far. To say, definitively, that I'm wrong or you're wrong shows tremendous arrogance.",10,0.8993721522151434,2025
"So, now you’re just rephrasing what I said about efficiency gains, but adding “nuh-uh” to the parts you don’t like and asserting that the magic jobs fairy will take care of the rest. 

Automation is absolutely about reducing labor costs. That is the primary factor. Period. 

You’re approaching this from a software perspective, where the market has been so incredibly warped by practically free money and stock/equity speculation the past decade and a half that you apparently have no conception of how things work in mature markets for hard goods. 

Cars are not software. You remove workers from the factory floor with automation, there is no other task they’ll be given. The jobs are gone forever. 

There maybe be *temporary* growth in the tech sectors that create the automation, but perhaps you didn’t notice those jobs are also on the chopping block over the next decade or so, and their growth most certainly does not match the numbers lost by implementing the automation on the factory floor. 

Companies are not going to find make-work for people to do when they become redundant. Eventually it reaches a point where there is more labor than demand for that labor, and when that point is reached, each round of layoffs represents a certain number of industry jobs *that are gone forever*. 

There’s no magic jobs fairy that waves its magic wand to create a corresponding number to replace those in some other industry. Your whole conception is predicated on a history of massive population growth and huge untapped markets to expand to. 

But guess what? We live in a globalized world now. Every industry is in every market. There are no new markets to expand to unless we meet aliens. The global birth rate trend is pointing down, and no government has come up with a policy effective at reversing it. It’s projected to be below replacement globally within the next decade. The old sources of growth are slowing more with every year, and in many places, are reversing. 

The fact you have to ask “what’s company growth if not industry growth” kind of gives away just how misguided your views are on this. If you don’t understand that one company taking market share from a different company is not industry growth, but rather just shifting revenue from one entity to another, then I genuinely do not know what to tell you. 

Demand for commodities in mature markets that have reached saturation and have no new markets to expand to is usually directly linked to population growth, and absent that, reaches an equilibrium where there is no more growth outside of efficiency gains which necessarily mean decrease in labor head count and cost. 

Not every market has reached this point, but the oldest ones have, and every year more get added to that list. For them, efficiency is the only growth horizon left, and they’re not going to throw that away to make up bullshit jobs to keep people employed when their shareholders are demanding returns.",10,0.914546588429984,2025

This was necessary because there were not enough people available for processing every little case. Now we use computers that have near infinite capacity for handling all our administration.

Some estimate that we would need trillions of humans to do all the administrative work computers already do today. But never have there been so many people doing office jobs, both in absolute numbers and percentage wise.

"In theory, automation means less need for human work. In practice, however, our economy doesn't necessarily respond to automation by actually allowing less work to occur.

Our central bank today operates on a mandate for ""maximum employment."" That means anytime the employment level threatens to fall, central banks stimulate the financial sector with cheaper debt; propping up more lending and borrowing and thus employment.

In other words, our society's normal response to advancements in labor-saving technology has been to create new jobs *anyway;* to push markets into sustaining a higher (I would say artificially high) level of employment. We are in, to a significant degree, creating jobs for jobs' sake.

Less jobs for humans should not be hard for anyone to stomach. It should be cause for celebration. More production potential *and* more leisure-time? What's not to like.

The trouble is, our society *expects* the average person to get their income by working for a job. This causes us to see job-loss as an occasion not for leisure but for poverty or despair. Whenever we think about declining work hours, we picture dwindling incomes; but does that necessarily need to be the case?

In an efficient, well-designed monetary system, automation should in fact mean more income, more spending power *and* more free time. That's the nature of efficiency developments: any new technology in theory should mean more goods produced for less labor used.

So why can't that happen in aggregate? Why are we all so terrified of letting the aggregate level of employment fall?

The key to resolving this apparent paradox is what some people call a UBI, or a universal income; that is to say, a regular source of spending money that \*doesn't\* arrive to people through labor or jobs.

We *assume* people need to get their income from work; in other words, we assume that a UBI isn't practical or ""wouldn't work"" for a variety of reasons. But around this as-of-yet-unprovable assumption, we have inadvertently designed a system that only knows how to benefit people who happen to be employed.  
  
This system is then forced to create jobs for the purpose of giving people income---totally apart from whether all these jobs actually constitute the most efficient use of resources.

In an ideal economy, robots do all the work and command all the resources and people get to kick back and enjoy all the goods. UBI--an unconditional source of income for all---is what should be allowing our real economy to get slightly closer to this ideal over time, as technology improves.  
  
In the absence of UBI, we're stuck looking at our economy backwards: complaining when we perceive any threat of jobs going away, as if the purpose of the economy was not to produce goods but to hire workers for hiring's sake.

A tremendous shift in perspective on this topic is sorely needed and long overdue. We need to learn how to see ourselves not as workers first and foremost but as beneficiaries of our economy; as people who are entitled to the maximum possible prosperity alongside the minimum labor requirement for no other reason that a better, more efficient, more leisurely-paced economy is *possible* and within our grasp.

"I think there's a lot of nuance that's lost when we reduce a large problem to that. On one side, people need jobs to get money to buy things. One the other side, companies that don't automate will go out of business due to their competition automating - it only takes one. The choice for the company is to either keep some employees with automation or lose all employees later to a company operating at 1/3 the costs through automation.

A majority of industries have advanced by moving from manual labor to increasingly efficient automated systems since industrialization began. This process has historically created new, often higher-skilled, jobs that offset the initial losses. Our current rate of technological advancement throws all that out the window and we're getting hit with job displacement, wealth concentration and workforce retooling issues.

The issue isn't simply about automation or some company's decision to. It's about how our entire economy is structured. Solving this requires a massive systemic shift around how our economy works - that's something only our government can do. Though they may be preoccupied with things that apparently.. trump this.",10,0.9324418895779774,2025
"The problem is that the companies that automate away all their staff will have a massive competitive advantage over those who don't. I do some work with a company that makes some pretty basic steel gates and stuff mostly for the agricultural market. We were doing some napkin maths and realised that if he could get a welding robot that was as efficient as one of an average worker but which could work 24/7 he could turn a profit on a $2 million cost per robot over 10 years just on wages alone. Once you factor in all the other costs, social insurance, health care, the extra space needed to have multiple workstations and so on the price could be almost double that and it would still make economic sense to go with the robot.

The point is robot workers don't even need to be cheap to start replacing humans. It will work even if they are what at first glance seems prohibitively expensive and even if you are, like this guy is, a good employer who values your staff, treats them well and understands the benefit these jobs will provide to the community he may well end up facing the grim reality of doing so or being out competed by someone else who does.",6,1.0,2025

 If many companies fire their employees than of course they collectively will have a massive effect on demand. But game theoretically there is no reason for any company in particular to not fire a bunch of employees.

 In this particular case however they will not replace any US jobs. They'll replace overseas jobs due to tariff incentives.

It is nice to have an AI customer service rep, I think they're actually better at answering questions, but when you need to talk to someone about something that falls outside of the guidelines of what the business has written down, that's where you still need humans, and that will never stop. Or for instance writing and art. Despite AI's winning in courts at the moment over copyright disputes. I don't think writing and artists will be in less demand, but it will be different demand. For instance, if you want to do a high budget art asset package, depending on the size, it might be better to hire an artist to train a LoRA for something you want, then apply that to the model you're using, and use that to generate your art assets. Same work, just different. Now there's room to talk about how much an artist would charge for it, since they're basically selling an entire character, not just art of the character, but that's a different issue.

Simple economics really. If you are a business owner, you want to produce things for the lowest possible cost, and sell at the highest possible price, in order to make the biggest profit you can. Buying technology is a cost, and hiring people is also a cost. So which one do you choose?

Answer: the cheapest.

But we know that the price of any product in the market is also the aggregate of all the labor that went into producing the thing. Or put another way; all jobs are costs, and all costs are jobs. Businesses are constantly trying to cut costs, so they are constantly trying to cut jobs. Rationally run businesses will only use technology if it allows them to cut jobs.

"Some people prefer to think in analogies instead of trying to use first principles. (Or maybe it's just whatever brings them to a comfortable conclusion.)

There are at least two problems with the industrial revolution as an analogy to understand what AI brings:
- time. This one is even in your write up. Time, as we all have a limited shelf life can hardly ever be ignored. If a change happens in years instead of decades that leaves a lot less time for the society (i.e. for a huge number of people) to accommodate. During the industrial revolution a lot less people had to face that their *field* was gone and had to change to a completly different one. We laugh at the Luddites as time has shown that people on average ended up in better jobs but did *they* end up in better, similar, or worse?
- AI promises (or scares us) with a much wider set of capabilities, much more flexibility than what automation could offer before. That is the whole point. The industrial revolution replaced a lot of physical hard work, a lot of repetitive labour and offered greater productivity and precision but people (well, not everyone, but sufficiently many) also had adequate cognitive abilities to do more thinking. And thinking was more productive it turned out. Now AI comes to take away that. What is left for all the humans to do if it succeeds? 

Most of the optimist predictions are based on the assumption that AI will be smart but also not too smart (or even dumb) at the same time, so that it will still need humans to control it.

Good one. 

I mean, you *were* just joking, right? Because [critical thinking skills are being eroded by AI as we speak. ](https://phys.org/news/2025-01-ai-linked-eroding-critical-skills.html) Showing people the facts doesn't make them change their mind. Just look at how many people still insist there are litter boxes in schools for students who identify as cats even when Rogan admitted he made it up. We literally have measles cases surging because people are afraid of vaccinating their kids because some talking heads on a news station told them to. (The same people who were the first ones in line for Covid 19 vaccines) 

How can you seriously say people would want fact checking in Generative AI with a straight face after COVID19? Or in the era of ""I have done my research"". 

If anything? Most jobs involved in fact checking and moderating AI content (Which, i might add, will be done by 1/100th of the people who handle that now with human run jobs, so it won't create as many jobs as you think) will just be to make sure it confirms your own opinion. Look at how the internet was supposed yo make people more educated and if anything it made them *dumber*. Because they don't look up the facts - they look up what they want and ignore anything that doesn't fit with their preexisting views.

And most jobs that curate AI content are done using a neat little trick: Unpaid labour and free samples. Offer someone a job with good pay... but require them to ""prove"" themselves by looking over things. You have 100 people looking over the content? Maybe one or even two will get the job if you're feeling generous. The others? You don't hire them but you still take the work.",-1,0.0,2025
"This isn't a good comparison to what's happening (or could happen, provided AI is good enough for corporations and rich to use it in place of existing labor, or believe that it's that good).

Let's imagine that AI (or automation marketed as such increases efficiency enough that businesses across the board cut their desk positions by 80%, and other positions such as factory and service jobs by big, big chunks. Where do the 80% of desk workers at Bumfuck international go?

Back in the day, one might say, ""Oh, those stablehands can get jobs at the car factory!"" But where's the metaphorical car factory? Is it a chip factory? There isn't a lot of that done in America and there are significant roadblocks to starting up. But also the factories have taken advantage of that efficiency--they don't need as many people. And most of the jobs cut are entry-level.

""Wait,"" you might say, ""why do you assume the entry-level jobs are the ones cut?"" Because that's where all the jobs are being cut, and there's no reason to assume that trend will reverse. When factory automation led to an explosion in the automobile market, most of the jobs created were entry-level; you needed people to man the assembly lines. We are seeing the opposite happen with GenAI. 

Well, maybe all those people can produce training data--except, like, AI companies are running out of training data and rather than hiring people to produce it (how could they even at the scales we're talking about?), they're just trying to get AI to produce more training data. 

This might be a good time to remind you that companies are adopting AI because they see it as a route to *not paying workers*. Which is why we're going to run into issues with things like tweaking and fact checking (lol) as careers in this brave new world. No company with the resources to hire all the people that got laid off from Bumfuck International is going to just to have them fact check AI.

If AI innovation continues along the current pattern of occasional big breakthroughs followed by gradual improvement, the transition may be slow enough that our political and economic systems will be able to adjust. AI may even be able to help ease the transition. 

If the worst case happens, and AI causes an economic depression and/or widespread unrest, that will suck, but it could also force politicians to set aside their differences and act, which might limit the damage.

As you mentioned, all generations feel doomed, but previous generations had problems that seemed equally bad at the time, and the world didn't ""fall apart"" over the long term. 

* In the 1970s, there was double-digit inflation and long lines for gas. Many were predicting the world would run out of affordable energy and the economy would collapse.
* In the 1940s, the US was at war. There was rationing of many products and some coastal cities were put under blackout conditions to guard against potential bombing. In Europe, many cities were bombed or occupied and there were significant food shortages.
* In the 1930s, The Great Depression put 25% of the population out of work. There were bread lines and malnutrition. The Dust Bowl devastated farming in the Great Plains.",13,0.1910759073478131,2025
"I am absolutely anti AI in everything but there was a sentiment I read in a manga that really sparked up a hopeful sentiment in me.

Which is exactly what I would want to be humanity's trend towards with the increase in AI. 

For that to become a reality there's so many things humanity has to overturn first. Socialist economic models should be the default and capitalism shouldnt be encouraged at all. Financial institutions that do not offer anything actually valuable to society like the wall street should be destroyed. Wealth has to be redistributed. Entire governments (including judiciary officials) need to be replaced by people who are younger, more adaptable to technology and actually literate in whatever domain they function in. To counter false narratives and the increase of propaganda, social media has to be a free space again and not a fucking bubble of dumb fucks jerking each other off and regurgitating fake bs to each other. Real civil discussion should be prioritised.  Humans need to work towards being globalists and thinking for the well being of everyone rather than whatever stupid fucking arbitrary race, religion, nationality they were born into.

"I work on maybe the first or second most famous AI project currently, many many more people have interacted with my project than have interacted with ChatGPT, for instance. I have been in tech for 25 years. I wrote the first ML based application to go live at Bank of America in 2005, it was one of a few innovations that helped crash the global economy by reducing the time to get a mortgage approved within federal guidelines (razor thin approvals) from over a week to under 5 minutes in most cases. I have patents in this area that have expired (20 years), I have patents that have not expired. I come from a background to really understand the impact on a global/tech scale. I still believe we are one hundred to one thousand years from spontaneous synthetic thought that isn't just a simple remix of 3-10 points of reference if I had to put a number to it, we are probably 1% of the way there. AGI is so incredibly complex compared to our most sophisticated model that I am pretty sure we will abandon it until we solve fusion.  

That is not to say things won't be heavily impacted by LLMs, but there is a limit to the amount of data a model can benefit from. The next decade will be about intentionally limiting data and ultra-specific models, and complex applications built around attempting to use multiple specialized models to solve problems, with a coordinating model which is just about picking which model to use for the next step...  because generalized models so far start to buckle and fold in on themselves after a point. AGI probably looks like a huge library of models and a huge library of coordinating models as connective tissue. A neural network model where the neurons themselves are independent models. And we are taking trillions of dollars in electricity and silicon to get to that point, not to mention the actual data sourcing which is increasingly hard, and not for legal or copywrite reasons... there just isn't enough high quality data in existence.  

Until we get a model that can train itself based on observations instead of spoon-fed data, we are 1% of the way to AGI. The race after that breakthrough will be in instrumentation to improve the observation capabilities. Once we have proven results from unsupervised observational training... then we will be at 2%.",13,1.0,2025

Tons of people will buy them like when vr became popular. It’s gonna be like a cool toy. Throughout this gpt, Gemini, grok, and DeepSeek will all have been being massively improved behind the scenes but with little to no change in consumer use. Maybe there’s a new up and coming Ai company that’s doing it better in some way, innovating on what we already have. 2027 - a breakthrough is made that sparks what is to be known as AGI. It learns, it reasons. It shocks the world. End of 2027 - Ai has become humanlike in its methods. This is the beginning of AGI. By 2028 it is implemented into autonomous robots and we also have Neuralink to communicate with them. By 2029 the government loses control. World slowly becomes decentralized as Ai takes over.

"AGI isn't coming, at best something that looks like AGI is coming, but all we're doing is obfuscating from the public what is really happening. All the AI's that talk to you, are just finishing sentences based on mathematical probability. And a fuck load of the weights we're throwing into these parameters that create these AIs are things like ""mmmmm dog fits with cat more often because word is here more often"" we can adjust things to do tricks, but at the end of the day, it's putting words together with numbers. 

So how is something like deepseek r1 doing reasoning, well deepseek r1 has a specific thing built in that processes its own output, but actually any LLM can do that. All that's really happening is the AI sees a prompt like ""Hey AI, how do you spell strawberry."" And there's a prompt around that that is something like 

""You're an AI that answers all of the users questions. The following is a question that you need to answer as an all knowing AI: ""Hey AI, how do you spell strawberry."" : Answer the question, be confident, and compliment the user. Put your response here:""

That's it, then the AI eats that and finishes the sentence. The thinking models will take that input and write out there answer, then read their own answer as an input with specific instructions to investigate it like a fact checker or an investigator. So they begin finishing sentences as such to answer the own slop they spit out. And it looks, like real thought.

But it's not, it's just a bunch of words being put together in a manner that feels right, based on human knowledge, and math, that no one is controlling in real time. So god forbid the internet spells strawberry wrong for 40+ years and fucks with the AI's parameters.

And the amount of weird connections an AI will make is insane. Like I've been messing with Stable Diffusion, and I noticed that if you tell the AI to make someone smiling, it will, but, the math tells it that anything that is a line of sorts needs to have this like curl to it, like a smile.

"There is no ‘solution to automation’ because automation isn’t a problem.

It’s useful for new machines to be invented. New machines can help businesses produce more goods for less labor.

Whether it’s a typewriter, a plow, a robot or AI it doesn’t matter. Anything that can help society get more goods for less labor is desirable and beneficial for the economy.

What AI is doing is drawing attention to the fact that wages and jobs—however useful they may be—are not the right way to distribute income across society. In an efficient market, jobs and wages regularly come and go according to the needs of efficiency.

So naturally people can’t rely on jobs and wages as a source of money with which to buy the economy’s full product. If there’s market pressure on all wages to go down or disappear, how can we expect incomes to go up through wages, as production processes improve?

Clearly another source of income is needed: a Universal Income.

With UBI in place automation won’t seem like a threat anymore. The more we automate, the more leisure time becomes possible; that just means the UBI can now be set higher. We can choose to allow the average person to enjoy both more spending power and more leisure time.

If we fail to implement a UBI in response to technological advancement the only other option is what we’re already doing now: creating unnecessary jobs as an excuse to distribute money instead.

The expectation that jobs should be available to everyone has been our real problem all along. It’s impossible to reconcile a vision of “maximum employment” with the world of leisure that our technology makes possible.

Our society is essentially addicted to wages and so-called job opportunities. But we have reached the limits of how much sense we can make out of the economy while still remaining attached to an employment-oriented lens.

The truth is it doesn’t much matter whether production is handled by machines or by human labor. What does matter is that people receive the full possible benefit of goods and services for as little labor as possible.

Our system—where income is restricted to wages, and consumer spending depends on job-creation—fails to achieve this outcome. UBI is necessary to move forward.",10,0.7927548892085347,2025

Submission statement: Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has announced sweeping layoffs of what he refers to as ""low-performers"" at his empire.

According to a company-wide memo [obtained by *Bloomberg*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-14/meta-is-planning-to-cut-5-of-lowest-performers-memo-shows?sref=YfHlo0rL), the Facebook owner is cutting around five percent of its staff. And interestingly, the directive is already in tension with what Zuckerberg [told podcaster Joe Rogan](https://futurism.com/the-byte/zuckerberg-automate-coding-ai) last week about how the company was looking to replace ""midlevel engineers"" with AI. Instead — in a likely concession to AI just not quite being up to snuff yet — he says employees ""who aren't meeting expectations"" will be replaced in order to ""bring new people in"" (emphasis on the ""people,"" for any AI zealots.)

""I’ve decided to raise the bar on performance management and move out low-performers faster,"" he wrote in the message, adding that terminated employees would be provided with ""generous severance.""

Zuckerberg wrote that 2025 will be an ""intense year"" that will require the ""strongest talent."" But what exactly he means by that remains unclear as the billionaire makes sweeping changes to the company's operations.

We’ve seen countless advancements—from labor laws to public education—once dismissed as idealistic.

By doing this, we free people to think outside the box and focus on what AI can’t replicate—true creativity, imagination, and critical thinking.

In this society, we are free to pursue any hobby, join any project, or follow any career path, driven by passion rather than necessity—imagine the purposeful life of Captain Jean-Luc Picard. For those who love to cook, the kitchen remains your domain. For others, automation might handle those tasks, offering flexibility and freedom.

Automation is central to this vision, designed to acquire resources and transform them into usable goods. By removing humans from labor-intensive and exploitative tasks, we eliminate the struggles that often define survival.

Other manufacturing?  Yes, with increasing costs.  Wherever something is repetitive and the costs can be justified, it will be installed.

Processing?  Very similar to assembly work and process automation has been going on for a long time already.  Expect more job losses here for sure.

Resource extraction?  Some, but practical and financial limits will apply.  They will exist more as intelligent tools for operators rather than independent units.  The job changes but doesn't necessarily go away.  

Customer Service work?  Sure, to an extent.

https://econofact.org/the-shrinking-share-of-middle-income-jobs

Professional, technical and managerial jobs have largely survived intact, but since 2000 these have also started to decline. AI will only accelerate this trend.

Low-pay jobs, such as in construction, are growing and seem likely to survive. At the very least, AI operated robots will need very significant human intervention to work.

But, if high paying jobs decline due to AI, there will be a severe knock on effect on construction.

"TLDR precis 

The article discusses the impact of automation on the construction industry, where robots and technology are increasingly replacing traditional manual labor. Automation, including robots for bricklaying, 3D printing, and drones, offers efficiency and safety benefits but raises concerns about job loss, especially for roles involving repetitive tasks. While robots excel in precision and tirelessness, they lack human workers' creativity and problem-solving abilities, which remain essential for handling unforeseen challenges on construction sites.

The rise of automation could displace some jobs but also create new opportunities in robotics maintenance and technology management, prompting the need for workers to develop skills. Automation can enhance safety by reducing human exposure to hazardous tasks, yet its adoption faces challenges such as high costs and technical limitations. A collaborative future is envisioned, where robots assist with dangerous or repetitive tasks while humans focus on creativity, oversight, and complex decision-making.

The social implications include the emotional toll on workers who fear job insecurity and the loss of blue-collar employment. Governments are urged to support the transition by investing in retraining programs and policies to protect workers. The future of construction will likely be a hybrid model, combining automation with human ingenuity to balance efficiency and the human touch.",-1,0.0,2024
"Is it highly susceptible to automation? Yes

Are AI or robots coming for construction? No.

Construction is one of those job sectors that can be heavily affected by simple automation, but where actual Robots or AI are unsuited.

The kind of places that are difficult for robots to traverse, and even more importantly where super expensive robots are likely to get damaged.

And honestly throwing AI at construction jobs is like trying to throw water at a brick to turn it into a wall. Completely the wrong way to go about things.

No, the things coming for construction jobs are extremely dumb automation. Things like better tools that let one person do more jobs faster.

When automation came for miners it wasn't via walking robots that did exactly what those jobs were, it was new machines and tools to do the work faster.

The materials used often aren’t perfect, the real-world conditions mean that quick pivots and reasoning are required in the moment, and the designer can’t or doesn’t think of every potential issue and intersection in advance.

I certainly think it is possible that robots will replace workers BUT there has to be a far more linked and cohesive chain from design through to construct (BIM in many cases has not lived up to this promise for a whole host of reasons). In addition, there has to be more reasoning ability than the robots currently display in order for them to respond to real-world, real-time conditions. And, we need to have a far more flexible approach to allow for those real world conditions.

AGI can be the CEO, CTO, CFO, CSO, COO, CMO and every supporting function below those roles down to the frontdesk lady. All at once. And way better at it too, since we now throw out human incompetencies and waste.

And jobs? If one AI can replace a thousand or ten thousand workers in exchange for one small team of AI engineers, it is still the utter destruction of the workforce. Then, that little team will also be thrown out once the AGI upgrades itself at a speed humans can no longer follow or comprehend.

"For centuries, our society and economic system has been implicitly designed around the objective of maximizing employment: providing job opportunities to workers who want them.

Although it still sounds commonsense to most people, adopting this goal has in fact been a tragic misstep in the evolution of our economic systems.

In our world, working for wages is considered normal; it’s how we all receive our money. The average person is *expected* to earn their living through a job; economic policymakers then create jobs for everyone to find.

However well-meaning an endeavor to create jobs may sound, the simple fact is that not all of these jobs and wages are actually necessary given our current level of technology.

Machines and methods are just as important if not more important than human labor as a factor of production. As technology improves, we should expect the share of production attributable to labor to decline, and the share attributable to everything else to increase in its place.

I’m saying: robots and computers have likely already “automated away” a great deal of useful human labor; but instead of embracing this outcome, our society has committed itself to creating more jobs anyway. We’ve been creating makework jobs as an excuse to distribute money to the average Joe and Jane.

Think about it. Technology has been advancing for centuries; we’ve had robots and “AI” in various forms for decades. Yet the employment level today is at a record high. Why? Because that’s exactly what society has been asking for: more jobs and more wages. So that’s exactly what central bankers and fiscal policymakers have to set out to achieve.

A serious reevaluation of the desirability of “full” or “maximum” employment is long overdue. The purpose of the economy is not to create jobs for their own sake: it’s to produce services and goods that people actually value. We should be looking at labor as a means, not an end.

Workers losing jobs to machines should already be an ordinary occurrence. And it ought to be no big deal; whenever wages disappear, labor-free income should arrive in their place.

And why not? Whenever technology improves, machine-assisted firms can in theory produce more goods for less labor. Extrapolate to the aggregate level, and that means the average consumer should be enjoying more purchasing power *despite* being less employed as a worker.

The average person should already be getting to kick back and enjoy an increasingly automated economy. Employment should already be falling and income should be rising.

The mechanism for allowing that to happen is obvious: a Universal Income, calibrated to our economy’s full potential.

Our monetary and fiscal policymakers—the same people who today manage the money supply towards an objective of creating jobs—should simply be distributing labor-free income instead. We create money to run the monetary system either way: why should that money enter the economy through employers and workers, instead of starting with consumers to spend however they like?

Without realizing it, we’ve accidentally *limited* our economy’s performance to the tune of wages and the size of the labor market. By unnecessarily withholding UBI, we not only hold back greater production and leisure for no good reason…. we are essentially wasting people’s time on pointless busywork, and churning through countless natural and industrial resources to support an artificially high level of employment.

Our political culture as we know it has completely overlooked this problem. We simply haven’t equipped ourselves intellectually to understand the problem of overwork.

The Left  is used to complaining endlessly about exploited workers, while the Right chides the poor to solve their poverty by getting a job. Neither side has yet grappled  with the fact that the whole point of the Industrial Revolution was to let technology *save* labor.

Our politics is stuck in a fruitless argument over ideals born in the 18th century; by conceiving of the average person as a worker first and foremost we’ve been unwittingly fighting against our own leisure-time tooth and nail for centuries.

Ever since we started inventing advanced assembly lines across the globe, human civilization should have gradually begun to implement a Universal Income. This labor-free income would serve two crucial functions simultaneously: it would provide firms the maximum financial incentive to produce, while also giving consumers the maximum possible purchasing power.

Instead, we’ve all doubled down on maximum employment, and designed a global macroeconomic system that’s dead-set on job-creation and high employment, regardless of the market economy’s actual need for jobs, and no matter the cost to the environment and society—costs which we either ignore or blame on the wrong things.

The longshoremen debacle is just a small example of how our society has refused to wake up from its “pro-employment” trance. Solving economic, social, and environmental problems *should* involve putting people out of work as problems get more and more efficiently and permanently resolved; instead, we’re unwittingly using our world’s issues as excuses to get paid.
 
We need to be talking about phasing in a UBI to gradually replace conventional monetary expansion, and provide our people the prosperity and free time that is actually possible. We should be letting the labor market shrink like it’s supposed to, while letting production and distribution rise to new heights.

Instead, we are fighting over scraps and protecting jobs that an efficient economic system should have eliminated already a long time ago.

What’s in the news today is just the tip of the iceberg. The entire global economy is one big make-work bubble, and few people yet realize it. We can pop this bubble anytime we choose: all we have to do is implement its logical replacement: a Universal Income made available to all, which gradually rises in pace with economic development. This will allow the labor market to do what it’s meant to do: pay for only the human labor that’s actually useful.

Our failure to implement such a system is the root cause of more economic trouble and needless toil than we yet realize.",-1,0.0,2024

Working both blue collar and white collar jobs, as well as being a minority in all aspects, I've seen the unity and the disparity between both. Automation has always been created as a way to ease the burdens on both sides. Certain people in certain positions at these companies that are charging customers more for less work (from the results of automation) should be investigated and morally/politically scrutinized; not solely the automation code. There should be price gouging penalties through automating. Or just make it outright illegal to charge a certain amount more in a certain time period if using less work.

"Perhaps a better issue for the union to address would be what happens to individual workers when automation takes their job, which for some it probably will. A different economic scenario is inevitable for us if we plan on evolving as a society. 

A possible solution is to first mandate the company pay a negotiated severance to the worker. Also, tax the robot that takes a job as though it was paid the same salary as the worker. If it works 24 hours then pay the tax for 24 hours of work. Use that tax revenue to pay unemployment and retraining expenses. The company would be responsible for paying the tax just as they essentially are now. An option for them would be to find an equal paying job elsewhere in the company. 

This would tend to slow down the automation process until the new scenario becomes economical to do so based on the added costs of the severance and tax.

I know that's the case because we caught a company owner doing it to his employees, they aren't union, so they couldn't do anything but play along and complain and hop to it when he says to.

something he can't do to us because we have negotiated contracts so that he CANT EVER do that to us, he can't play with our money, he can't talk trash to us or we can file paperwork against him.....people who are not in unions only talk like this because THEY DONT KNOW.

A bot could be programmed to complete all of those tasks, sure, but its still faster to train a human to do it in a single work day. Or a week.

Further, diagnostics and executing comprehensive repairs on any robot would demand a human being, because we literally don't have machines that will work in that capacity, and programming one will take years.

Those TV shows and movies where spaceships and space stations are full of maintenance droids are fiction for a reason. We are not there yet. And you'll notice, there's still tons of work that requires a lot of human power to complete.

We also haven't touched simple labor jobs such as cooking, cleaning and medicine - all of which are so wide and varied that we are nowhere near ready from a programming perspective or an engineering perspective to replace the human workforce.

Llms can replace artists because it's incredibly easy to generate what is effectively random shapes & colors in a given image area, especially when you can train the model using the billions of bytes of image data we currently have at our disposal.

Fact is, physical labor will always be in demand somewhere. Art and music creators will not be, because a bot can do that much more cheaply and without the drama associated with dealing with such people.

In this case it very obviously is not.

"I certainly understand not wanting to lose your job. I didn’t like it when after 35 years my job was offshored, but that happened. As much as I didn’t like it, I get it. It’s a more affordable option. I wish that companies did not offshore jobs, but they do and there’s nothing I can do about it. The situation with the longshoreman is different. It’s not about profit and cost-savings, it’s about productivity and upgrading the process, and this union and these employees are standing in the way of that. I have read that the United States ports are woefully outdated, and the process is inefficient. Who are these individuals to think their needs are bigger than the American economy? If we could stay away from automation and have a port that is competitive with other countries that have automated, then great, but that is not the case. Nobody wants to lose a job, but holding back improvements to something as important as US import/exports for the benefit of the few is not right, and it should not be allowed to happen. From my understanding these jobs are not highly skilled, and by that I mean they don’t require extensive training like a plumber or an electrician, so these people should be able to find other jobs. It appears a lot of them are young, so they could probably even go back and get some training in something that would pay similar wages. I don’t think the ILA is doing these workers any favors, because eventually they will automate and the sooner they recognize that and find other paths for their lives the better off they will be. Going on strike when there are four or five states devastated by Helene who are in dire need of supplies just adds to the selfishness and greed.

  
Edit:  I just saw an interview with one of the strikers. He made the comment asking who was going to take care of their kids and pay their mortgages if they allow automation.  I don’t mean to be insensitive, but no job is guaranteed and to essentially stop American port system improvements so these people can make the big bucks, I’m sorry that is not the way things work. Companies don’t create unproductive, subpar business models just to keep people employed. It’s about productivity, efficiency and quality. Unfortunately that sometimes means a job loss.",53,1.0,2024

"I am very conflicted about all of this.

At my core I’m pro-union. Collective bargaining is fundamental to workers’ rights. We owe a lot of our modern privileges to the work of unions and socialists of the past. My values are aligned with unionization and collectivization.

However I have some fears regarding the temporal myopia of humans. I think it’s an all-encompassing issue. Capitalists will automate without thinking of the repercussions (robots can’t buy things, humans won’t have money to buy things). But the other side of the coin is also exhibiting some myopia.

Automation will take people’s jobs and dramatically raise unemployment. This is true. But ideally we would use automation as a tool to achieve Post-Labor Economics. The unions can’t see that. Their ethos is to keep humans working. 

Right now, that is a good thing, and so I’m still on the side of the unions and worker solidarity. Automation is not at the point where it can shoulder most of humanity’s responsibilities. So keeping human employment high is a good thing. 

But once we have androids that can do pretty much anything a human can physically do, and AIs that can do most human jobs, I believe it’ll do far more harm than good. I think the worst future is one where humans don’t have to work, but still force themselves to work because they’re trapped in a mindset where work is virtuous.

We can subsidize these programs by the increased economic productivity of automation, but that's not the direction in which we've moved, and a lot of structural elements of our society would have to change for that to occur.

"The loss of jobs due to advances in technology is not a new phenomenon—it’s something humanity has experienced since we first invented tools. Every major technological breakthrough, from the Industrial Revolution to the digital age, has displaced certain types of work while creating new opportunities. In my opinion, this process is essential for technological progress, as automation and innovation can lead to increased efficiency, higher productivity, and the potential for human creativity to be focused on more complex or meaningful tasks. The faster we adopt these technologies, the quicker we can benefit from these advancements, allowing society to progress more rapidly.

However, the real challenge lies in how society handles the displacement of workers whose skills have become obsolete. It’s not enough to simply celebrate technological progress; we need to ensure that we create pathways for those affected by it. This includes retraining programs, social safety nets, and the development of new industries that can absorb displaced workers. If we fail to address this, we risk widening inequality and leaving large segments of the population behind.

"Unemployment can only skyrocket if there exist people to be unemployed. 

If the working class can no longer afford children because they can’t find any employment. Then the only ones enjoying this post labour future are the upper class.

The only reason why western countries have a positive birth rate is because of immigration from countries that still have high birth rates. 

Poor countries have historically had high birth rates out of necessity, for instance to labour on farms. Diseases, famine, war, poor medical care all contributed to keep the global population in check. Birth rates have exploded due to technology addressing these ills. 

As these countries industrialize, their birth rates will fall and emulate first world birth rates, and western countries birth rates will fall into the negatives because of this. 


How does this relate to your point? 

The rich elite only have to keep employment rates high enough until this demographic shift occurs. Once they no longer need the proletariat to keep the machine running, we will simply cease to exist.

So worrying about unions stopping a post labour future from happening is silly. A post labour society is inevitable.  The technology is already there to automate most of our labour. And what labour can’t be automated mostly exists to serve a large population that won’t exist in two generations.

"Singapore and Abu Dhabi can afford to send taxi drivers into unemployment; they are have tiny populations and high GDP per capita. 

I don’t think that the situation will play out the same domestically, for a few reasons:

1. People are watching. Uber could disrupt traditional taxis bc no one was paying any attention. That is over. Everyone is watching this space. Taxi drivers, of course, but also doctors, lawyers, and software engineers. Don’t underestimate the rich, powerful and educated when they see their interests threatened.

2. Unrestrained disruptions would be massive. Taxi drivers are one thing, cargo and delivery drivers are another. No American president is going to preside over the end of some of the last good paying blue collar jobs. Biden and Trump are both competing for the union vote now. Just like bipartisan consensus aligns against Til Tok, there are easy and ample political hurdles to throw up in the way of AI. This will hinder development but doesn’t need to halt it completely. A few “pilot cities” is all the U.S. needs to continue advancing Ai driving technology. 

3. Government will step in bc there are minimal economic downsides. Outlawing AI trucks for freight will increase costs and lower corporate profits. But trucking companies generally don’t have to compete with, say Singapore. All your competitors will be forced to use human drivers. And any costs passed onto the consumer will be more than outweighed by the salaries paid to the drivers and maintaining the economic engine.

4. But there will be dislocations in two situations: 1. Where the dislocated workers have no political voice, and 2. Where international competition forces efficiencies. Under 1, I can very much see large cities doing away with taxi drivers. Rich New Yorkers and San Franciscans will love dirt cheap robo taxis. Under 2, international shipping will eventually go all-AI. Super long container ships already have minimal crews. These will be scaled down further as soon as it becomes economical.

"Robots and AI will *not* change the aggregate level of employment. They will make it more obvious that many human jobs are already unnecessary.

Propping up the employment level has been the central bank’s job description for over a century. They’ve gotten quite good at it.

An enormous amount of credit and money is continuously flooded into the economy from the private financial sector, as a result of central bank expansionary monetary policy.

Individual jobs are created or eliminated by individual market actor. But how many jobs exist in markets *in aggregate* is a policy decision, and has been for some time.

Do we *want* people to enjoy the fruits of labor-saving technology? Is leisure time an objective we want to organize society around?

Then we need to introduce a UBI (labor-free income) and actually make it possible for markets to use labor more efficiently than they currently are.

An efficient economy would have been reducing the aggregate level of employment since the start of the Industrial Revolution.

We don’t live in an efficient economy. We are currently using macroeconomic policy to prop up the labor market as a giant income-delivery system.

Currently a restaurant without workers is more or less a vending machine with seating. And automats in the past haven't found much traction, especially when they are competing on price point with fast food as automation is still more limited in what it can make, and will be for some time.

The wider issue is that right now, for example, the most successful fast food robot, Flippy, costs 17$ an hour to run and can only do the fryer. Other tasks such as operating a grill cost even more and unlike a frier which cooks in batches are much slower than a human so you'd need more of them. So humans will remain cheaper as long as they can work multiple stations/rolls for a while now. Even if they double or triple the minimum wage.

"A major barrier for people to enter the blue-collar market is the unions.

I think many white collar workers, who went on to pay $300,000 for college, are going to mentally struggle with the idea of transitioning to a blue-collar job that doesn’t even require a high school degree. They may eventually succumb due to necessity.

">AI Audits for Transparency: One idea is that while humans have authority, AI could run regular audits on those decisions. AI can’t intervene in government or directly control resources, but it would make the audits public. That way, everyone can see how decisions are being made and if people in power are being fair.
>Accountability through Transparency: If the public has access to this info, it becomes a way to keep power in check. People would know if resources are being mismanaged or if someone’s taking more than they should. And since everything’s out in the open, society as a whole can decide if the system is working.

The second part first. This aligns with my own thinking and trends that are accelerating. The heart of sustainability is accountability. The heart of accountability is transparency. Information is power. That is the defining feature of society. The control of material resources has always been dependent on the control of intellectual resources. For most of our history, that control has been the purview of an imperial bureaucracy that collected as much relevant information as possible and distributed it to the imperial administration. Over the last few centuries, the West has been privatizing the empire, which has accelerated exponentially over the last few decades under neoliberalism. 

This has resulted in several major issues. First, the majority of information is now private, outside of the reach of public administrators (imperial or otherwise), and so our systems of governance are now operating with even less information than they had historically. Second, modern industrial countries have built a respectable apparatus for collecting *statistics*, but have not been as successful in turning that data into *information*, and even less successful in enabling actual democratic governance. (I believe traditional liberal representative democracy has run its course. Its mechanism barely worked in a pre-industrial society. They are completely inadequate to govern a complex industrial society. More on this  below.) Third, privatization occurred under capitalism that treats intellectual resources the same as material resources. This incentivizes the creation of more proprietary media at the expense of public information. The highest quality information is locked behind pay walls, confidentiality agreements, classified documents, etc. The Internet has accelerated this trend exponentially as well.

A democratic society will only succeed if it has access to the necessary and sufficient data to govern appropriately (i.e., according to an informed decision-making process towards whatever goal the constituents want.) A clear example of this are the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). An ambitious fifteen year project that covers nearly every aspect of society, it is woefully short of achieving its targets in large part because most of the developing world lacks the capacity to even collect enough data to measure their current status, let alone meeting any target, and most of the developed world lacks the leadership and coordination necessary to align their interests towards any common goal.

The (sliver) of good news is that we are moving towards greater transparency with the adoption of ESG reporting at the organizational level and with the implementation of environmental management systems (EMS) and life cycle assessments at the operational level. A major initiative within the accounting profession is working on the interoperability of systems to provide data for all relevant reporting requirements and share that data with all relevant stakeholders.

The addition of AI enables pattern discovery that may not be obvious such as spending just below material limits, or the use of a specific vendor when better alternatives are available. AI is simply improving existing tools and vastly expanding their data crunching ability. When corporations have millions of transactions daily, such scale is necessary.

AI will be an incredible assistant to support governance, yet should never be the decision-maker. Ideally, AI would process the data and provide various scenarios that a team of experts could select from, and then the AI could assist with the administration and evaluation of the selection. Ultimately, AI will increase the need for expertise rather than diminish it, so we still need people to learn and study various disciplines. 

>That way, everyone can see how decisions are being made and if people in power are being fair.

This is where liberal democracies are failing. As the complexity of society increases, decisions are becoming more opaque. Legislators are rarely experts on what they are regulating, and they increasingly need to rely on non-governmental experts. With the privatization of information, the necessary expertise is becoming more difficult to obtain. Radical transparency is worthless if no one can understand the rationale behind decisions. And no one can understand the rationale behind every decision. The complexity of our systems has long passed the point of generalization. (The expectation that judges are capable of ruling on the technical details of such complex systems is a major reason why overturning the Chevron doctrine is such an absolutely horrible decision. The Roberts court guaranteed that everything will get far worse before anything gets better. The rule of law has become itself illegitimate. Science doesn't care about legal opinions. Mother Nature and Father Time don't give a fig about your political beliefs.)

What then? If liberal representative democracies are incapable, who or what is? I advocate for a radically different form of democracy where everyone is required to participate and collaborate. Legislators would be replaced with ""collegiums"", and everyone would belong to a college. (A foundation would oversee the various colleges and try to ensure each college has enough members. A new college would have to meet a threshold to participate. Details determined later. Some may fade away due to obsolescence.)

A collegium has three main traits. First, the body consists of 'colleges' of experts in various policy areas. The main college would have a broad mandate - commerce, health, education, technology, etc, while subcommittees would focus on specific issues. For example, the college of health would have panels for pediatrics, geriatrics, internal medicine, etc. Second,
each member has approximately equal power yet narrow authority. They can issue decisions on their specialty, but nothing outside of it. Third, decisions would be mainly guidance and only binding if adopted.

The ISO is a primary example of this schema. Technical committees draft and issue standards, yet they are only binding if an organization or a local jurisdiction explicitly adopts them. Anyone can formally withdraw from the standards at any time. The main source of compliance are independent audits that issue opinions on if the standards were followed. An organization that fails an audit would likely be censured by its peers or barred from practice in a particular jurisdiction. 

Governance would not be representative, but delegative. It would not be majoritarian,  but based on consensus and collaboration. It could not be authoritarian since a collegium would have no direct authority. It would be authoritative since they would issue the formal standards. Third parties could still rely on other standards (cf GAAP vs IFRS, or imperial vs metric). An organization would be required to disclose what standards, if any, they have adopted.

What does this mean in practice? Each college would have its own AI to assist with their field. Each college would determine its own criteria for membership, and would support the professional development of its members. Members (i.e., everyone) would have at least one day per week to participate in discussions, attend continuing education seminars, read journals, evaluate proposals or drafts, and finally issue recommendations as needed. When a college has achieved a consensus, they would release a standard or an update. 

To ensure radical transparency, there would be investigators or inspectors. They would have carte blanche to conduct an inquiry and then issue a final report. Intentional interference of an inquiry would lead to public censure. The abuse of an inquiry by an investigator would result in their mandatory resignation if substantiated. 

People could switch colleges if they want to (with an introductory/probationary period to prevent 'brigading'), yet could only belong to one at a time and only serve on one committee at a time. They could attend meetings and otherwise participate in another college, but could not vote or issue recommendations. 

I think AI will be an invaluable resource for governance, but it can never be the actual governor. It can assist with inquiries, but could never be the actual investigator. It can assist with the allocation of resources, but never be the main provisioner.",-1,0.0,2024

The interviewer gave a brief introduction about Meituan and asked a series of canned questions like, “What was a challenge you came across in the past?” After each answer, the interviewer would summarize what was said and offer a follow-up question.

But Tan told *Rest of World* it felt more like taking a written exam than having a conversation. “I didn’t take it as a real human,” she said. “I just looked at the camera and talked.”

>Once seen as a curiosity, AI job interviews have grown in popularity as startups look to build businesses on top of the surprising capabilities shown by platforms like OpenAI. The industry is still small, and the jobs affected are often large-scale roles where companies need to sift through thousands of applicants at once.

Growing up it was the “go to college” so you don’t become one of the “they took our jobs” blue collar people. So I did that. As an adult, I watched my mom’s white collar job get outsourced, multiple times actually. The same job. They sent it out and when it blew up, brought it back and asked her and her colleagues to fix it. I remember being furious with her for not telling her company to eff off. This was around 2005 the first time and then it just became a pattern. 

Anyway, my entire professional career, starting in 2008 (lucky me) has been heading towards this. CAE was the part of engineering that interested me the most, but at some point a decade ago I saw the writing on the wall and pivoted. The software got much better, the internet got much faster and most importantly, the access to the software became much easier. The world is full of engineers and we’re  (USA) the most expensive. This was all before AI even entered the conversation. I just can’t see the math working out in our favor. 

There is some poetic justice here I guess, as us white collar people didn’t treat the factory workers that lost their jobs so well. At least they had a way out though. It’s an incredibly difficult thing to change careers late in life, but I suppose they could go back to college etc. 

What options do we have? I’m a mechanical engineer, although my job now is mostly program management and the base engineering is done elsewhere (Mexico, China, India etc) What should I go back to college and get a degree in?

"CEO’s are just salesmen that work for the board of Directors.  They don’t make the day to day decisions that’s the COO.  CEO is easily replaced by a digital avatar.

First they came for the front desk receptionist , and I did not speak out—because I was not a front desk receptionist, and honestly, I never understood why they insisted on making me sign in on a clipboard when I clearly had an appointment.

Then they came for the warehouse workers, and I did not speak out—because I was not a warehouse worker, and I figured robots would at least remember where they put things, unlike Kevin from shipping who once lost an entire pallet of office chairs for three months.

Then they came for the middle managers, and I did not speak out—because I was not a middle manager, and frankly, an AI probably couldn’t make meetings any more pointless than they already were.

Then they came for the CEOs, and I did not speak out—because I was not a CEO, and I was genuinely curious to see if an artificial intelligence could somehow justify a 500x pay ratio while laying off half the workforce with a straight face.

Then they came for me, and there was no one left to speak for me—except for ChatGPT, who offered to write my unemployment appeal letter for free, but somehow made it sound like a haiku about synergy and disruption.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",1,0.5887575020426086,2025

And with Amazon having different policies for different groups for every different building... It's a damn mess.  They already have thousands of random programs with no support.  Every time you find one that works well for something, they kill it off the next month, citing some new ai garbage or security concern.

They have a whole internal wiki with hundreds of thousands of pages, nearly all of them are completely outdated, empty placeholders, and/or full of dead links.  And their tech teams have used so many acronyms that are industry standard terms for actual things people need to look up, that you can't find useful information 2/3 of the time without getting walls of Amazon centric tech jargon.

There's teams of people who work to consolidate information that other teams are already consolidating.  Which  completely cancels out the whole point of their jobs and leads to multiple different hubs full of the same information from slightly different sources.  Nearly all of which end up abandoned after a round of layoffs.

"> The CEO did offer his workers, some of whom are likely wondering just how long they’ll be employed, how to potentially survive the next round of layoffs (or, maybe more likely, help train their future replacements). “As we go through this transformation together, be curious about AI, educate yourself, attend workshops and take trainings, use and experiment with AI whenever you can, participate in your team’s brainstorms to figure out how to invent for our customers more quickly and expansively, and how to get more done with scrappier teams.”

He’s trying to make this a self-fulfilling prophecy. “Everyone, you’re going to be replaced by AI if you don’t figure out how to do as much as possible with AI”.

In fairness, I guess, I think this is in part just him reflecting his own stress onto the workforce, because tech CEOs are under analogous pressure (or, even if you think AI is all hype, they believe they are). From his perspective, _companies_ either figure out how to leverage AI as much as possible, or get replaced by the ones that do.

Car invented = created jobs for driving services, people who service it, develop fuel/parts, build roads, and build the fairly disposable cars themselves.

AI: replaces workers in auto manufacturing, road construction, service with robots, and replaces drivers, and reduces the number of cars.

John Maynard Keynes made predictions about how much of our lives we would be working in 2030, based on his observations about the rate of improvement in economic output and the efficiency of labour.

His predictions for economic output and labour efficiency are pretty much on track, but he also predicted we’d be working 15 hours a week. 

Working hours have declined in the last 100 years, but we are actually working more than we technically need to. The difference can mostly be explained by extra consumption. I don’t mean that we’re all greedy; I mean that our economy is fuelled by the fact that we have convinced people that they need to buy more things. Or at least it used to be.

Now, it’s fuelled increasingly by the fact that people need to consume more, while actually owning less, as more and more of the services (vital or otherwise) are transferring to a rent-based model.

I think it’s easy to dismiss the missives of tech executives as hubris and arrogance, and I don’t think that what has frustratingly become synonymous with AI is actually capable of replacing as many workers as some tech executives believe.

However, this is a real societal problem and nothing is being done about it. We are headed in a direction where there are fewer and fewer reasons for humans to spend their time working, and fewer and fewer things where human labour is better than automated alternatives. This is a trend that will continue.

For some stupid fucking reason, the sociopathic sub-humans that thrive in the society we’ve created and now act as the decision makers for all of us have no interest in working towards a future where we can all enjoy the benefits of this automation by spending our time engaging in fulfilling pursuits, such as sport, literature, art, music, film, child rearing, caring for animals, stamp collecting, video games or whether the fuck else.

IMO this is a common error in thinking that leads many people to discount the immediate threat to employment that AI poses. It doesn't have to be able to do a job end-to-end in order to eliminate a job.

I bet you would say that Claude has made you more efficient -- let's pick a 5% improvement. That's not a lot. It's allowing you to do 42 hours of work in a 40 hour week, which is really far away from being able to do your *whole* job.

But as soon as that's true for twenty people, you've just eliminated the need to hire one person. Their 40 hour work week is just distributed across the existing, AI-boosted employees.

To a first approximation, whatever percentage efficiency AI adds to a given worker is the percentage of that role, *across the whole company*, that can be eliminated.

However, creating real, functional applications involves complex architectures that current AI simply cannot manage on its own. But when an adept programmer harnesses the power of AI, tasks that once took weeks to resolve can be tackled in a fraction of the time.

but I would very honestly argue that nearly all jobs are very much in AI's crosshairs... but I would put the timeline for that at somewhere between 10 to 20 years at least. and I think being in the crosshairs doesn't necessarily mean that the jobs will disappear, just that large portions of many jobs will be highly automated.


the part that's frustrating to me as a data scientist is that most of this is going to be from the same thing we've been doing for half a century now, which is just standard automation. it's not AI. it's not ML. it's not statistical learning. it's largely not even analytics. it's just straight up software engineering, it's automated scripts at a very high level. yes, there are some portions that consume a lot of data and may use a model for decision making or dealing with uncertainty... but largely these situations could be handled without any knowledge of these topics.


and the reason I find that frustrating is that in every job I've had for about the last decade, they're always asking me what we can do with AI and ML. and I give them answers... real ones... but it's never what they want. what they want is just software engineering. they want to automate things. data pipelines, dashboards, whatever. the number of problems that would require a graduate degree in statistics or computer science or applied mathematics, at least in the business world, is vanishingly small. and yet when you apply for a job, this is exactly the criteria that they judge you on. you have to have these degrees, many jobs even will specify a PhD (which you won't be using that in almost any situation outside of a true research position). they ask you advanced modeling questions that you can't really answer unless you've taking the courses and done the modeling. 


but then you get into a role and they have some basic rules-based solution that they've been using for decades probably, and there's no real need for any kind of advanced modeling. what's really needed is the software/data engineering to join up all of the existing stuff they have and make it more efficient. and the reason that matters is because that's what they're shipping overseas. and it's the same thing we've been shipping overseas for decades. but as you point out, AI is doing something new: it's giving them cover to do what they were already doing on a much more massive scale. they can just say it's all about AI, they can blame AI for job losses and they can tell management that they're using AI to make themselves look good. as you say, it's a smokescreen.",-1,0.0,2025

AI definitely isn’t just a corporate buzzword. Is it hyped up? Yes. But it definitely can make someone much more efficient depending on their role.

Corporate isn’t going to care that I’m a designer with a degree and X amount of years experience in the field and have the ability to augment my work with AI at a much higher level.

"I'm an IT Auditor in a local market leader, that doubles as critical infrastructure. The company got bought and is now part of a larger international company.  Our company always had record profits one year after another. Today, it is underperforming.

Our mother company is crazy about ""cutting"" costs, we had mass lay-offs in already understaffed departments, we were forced to outsource key-competencies, and people who were supposed to be replaced by ""near shoring"" never got replaced since qualified people couldn't be found.... And yet, our costs are at a record high. Partly due to the need for absolutely incompetent and overpriced consultants to replace lost in-house staff, but more than that we massively overpay license fees to our mother company and even pay for services, which ultimately our mother company calls our own employees to do themselves.

The quality of work within the whole company has massively suffered.... and the tools we are now forced to use are more often than not worse than what we had before, while leading to additional manual labour to make up for noncompliance with local laws and more required quality control. Since we were taken over, multiple multi-million dollar incidents have occurred, many of which were based on services hastily outsourced to our mother company, while being strong-armed to delay SLA-creation for already outsourced services, making it so that our mother company couldn't be held accountable, while all our bonuses got cut to make up for the losses.

To make matters worse, now our mother-company is pushing their own AI tools, which are so bad that they can't even do the work of the basic windows search function, they e.g., consistently bullshit you when simply asking you what page a certain chapter headline is from. Of course, our mother company again receives massive license fees for them.

Now, as an internal auditor I have a save job, as my work is regulatorily required. I have good working conditions, a great team and comparatively a good wage. I do a great job and receive appreciation from those I work with. I'll likely stay, but it still hurts to see everything fall apart and the team that build such a great company be dismantled to be replaced with less qualified people, worse tools and less control over our services.

As an auditor, it is my responsibility to highlight risks. Nothing is more frustrating than pointing out the risks and inefficiencies that arise to be ignored because of ""corporate policy"" (=mother company exploits all daughter companies for maximum profit).

What’s happening is this: senior leads set the prompt strategy, shape how systems work, and manage company knowledge in structured ways like RAG. As the tools improve and system prompts get better, more of the hands-on prompting and eval work shifts to junior staff or outsourced help. At the same time, entry-level roles are disappearing or changing, which makes it harder for new talent to break in. Prospective college students are reconsidering their computer science degrees. International students are worried about their visas to do research in the States.

I know people don't _want_ AI to be good, but so many people confuse the is with the aught.

- one that has an entire index of your code, not just the current file 
- with the right model (some are better at certain tasks)
- with Max window size (expensive but with a lot better memory)
- in Agent mode (so it can have a train of thought and perform multiple tasks in a sequence)
- with the right configuration (very important, you need to tune it and give it proper context)

Just yesterday, I told it that we were getting blank images in a render then left to make a coffee. Without any other intervention: It read the code, made a guess on what's wrong,  added logs so it can test its assumption, ran the program, read the logs, self corrected its assumption based on the logs, made a new guess, created a debug script to test the renderer in isolation, made a script to analyse the images if they were really white or just low contrast, creased a fix, ran the program again, ran it's test scripts, summarised everything for me.

The whole process took about 15 minutes but it's very close to the process I would have followed. I reckoned it would have taken me a few hours to do the same things. 

Now, it's not always this smooth. It makes stupid assumptions a lot of the time, but even when it fails it leaves me with something useful.

Yes, it's good at some things, and sometimes it can do things completely unassisted, depending on how complex the task is, but in my experience it also goes horribly wrong with alarming frequency... it'll recommend outdated, deprecated, or sometimes completely wrong code.  I try feeding the errors back into itself or guide it in the right direction and it often just gets worse. I spend much of the supposed productivity gains from the easy tasks debugging what it spits out when it tries to do something more complex.  Not to mention it definitionally can't do more creative work... if there's not established training data for the model it can't give you an answer, but here's the worst part... it'll pretend like it can. 

So cool, some manager can create a simple app to do something with just AI, but what happens when he wants to add more to it and it starts getting more complex? Or something that requires a bit of reasoning to puzzle through? Or how do they know it's doing it correctly? Who's going to debug it when it hallucinates so badly it breaks the entire app? And what about legal ramifications, maybe it does something like leak private data?

The fact that these latest models put out answers that sound so good makes it easy to by into the hype, but hallucinations are a really big problem... the answer sounds good to a layman, but could be completely wrong. 

AI tools are definitely helpful, and they're only going to get better, but they're nowhere close to what the hype says they can do.

"I work for a large tech company. I was laid off in January. I was immediately rehired… for $25k less. I was under the impression when I took the replacement role it would be less/different work, it was not. 

My account base was downgraded from LE to RE, ONLY in name. Entire divisions were cut by as much as 80%. These accounts were complex in nature and to say there are pissed off corporations who no longer get a level of white glove they’re accustomed to is an understatement. People who knew the product sets and skills behind implementation/management are just gone. Centuries worth of knowledge just poof. Those inheriting the accounts have no idea how to do the jobs they’re being asked to. 

I went from being salary to hourly where I was expected to put in 60 hours to now told I only have 40 - same level of pressure to get the same results in a smaller timeframe. I can’t work overtime but I MUST hit the deadline, plus all this new training that in itself is 20+ hours that they will schedule you for after hours… yet, you aren’t paid - it’s flawed and I’m not doing that, it’s getting slowly done on company time. 

I went from FTO to PTO and they cut the number of those hours you accrue by 30%. I have most my same accounts and can’t take time off without having someone cover me - which I didn’t need to before, if my book of business was handled and I set expectations of being OOO, it wasn’t a big deal. It is now…

They changed the bonus structure to both a pooled and and individual level, which sounds weird, but it doesn’t matter if I close $42k in sales a month if the next person on my team only clears $5k. I don’t get the spiff if the region doesn’t hit the sales goal despite me hitting the personal contribution goal - I will never see a commission cheque again. 

We’re not paying out on legacy products even if we sell it daily because of a customers existing services. Some of these take 6 months and 100’s of hours, we don’t get the credit for the sale. We do get perpetually reminded of this fact and to not spend time doing this - gotta go sell the new products and have 2-3 year install timelines… when we haven’t even finished projects we sold in 2022, that are now obsolete.

"Here's the thing: I'm all for automation. Giving repetitive, dangerous tasks to machinery so that humans can pursue their passions is a good goal. The problem is that with automation comes job loss, and not everyone that loses their current job can easily slot into a new job. Animation is a good example of this - painting cels was tedious and time-consuming, so digitizing it made sense. But a lot of 2D animators left the industry during the switch to CGI because their skills didn't translate to computers (especially back in the days of the floppy disk.) They were talented, but corporations chased the shiny new object and left the talented artists without a paycheck. Many of them had to leave the industry and find work in unrelated fields to pay their bills. The same thing is happening now, actually, because the streaming bubble has popped.


The solution is shorter work weeks with good pay. Say a task used to take five guys 100 hours, but now it only takes 80 hours due to machinery. Standard practice is to fire one guy and have the other workers do their standard 20 hours. But you could instead reduce everyone to 16 hours and still have enough workers to do the task, while making sure everyone gets their bills paid.

If you are elderly, sick, disabled. Then we as a society should take care of you. 

If you work full time and still cannot make ends meet.  Then the government needs to pay..  Why?...  Because if they were doing proper governing, a full time job would be all a person needs to survive comfortably.

"There is absolutely not real and concrete technology in regards to AGI. We have perceptrons, ML algorithms and predictive text and art generation. What we don't have is frameworks for self learning, especially in an environment that is dynamic. For example, we don't have systems that can be plugged into a robot and learn even a simple task. There is no comprehension or reasoning. ML is just not doing what people think it is. 

Perceptrons can barely interpret their surroundings. They can only somewhat recognize patterns they are trained on.

Things like go are very narrow environments with explicit and simple rules, these do not mimic reality. You can train an AI to be good at Go, but we have yet to even get competent AI into most video games. 

Looking at stuff like GO and seeing improvement isn't a yardstick to compare AI into other things. Perceptrons have existed for 50 years, and haven't had a similar trajectory to computers playing go or chess. This is because the task isn't as narrow and well defined. 

Anyways, the technology is very interesting and can absolutely integrate and change the way some things are done, but it's not coming to replace people. Some processes could in the next decade be ceded to AI, but these are all ones already on the automation chopping block. AI being able to do some tasks efficiently will open up opportunities for workers in other areas. AI and machine learning in general creates far more jobs than it takes away, and this is a trend with no signs of reversal in the near future.

Finally, in regards to AGI, like I said we are no where near that. We are on the other hand getting close to the physical limits of transistor miniaturization. Our capacity for compute isn't going to rapidly advance, and as such AI cannot do so either. This should be enough to put to rest the most imaginative concerns.

Working in the private sector, I have not had a single job that AI was capable of replacing me in. AI however could have been utilized in a number of ways to make me significantly more efficient. This is where I see AI going in the near term. It will create jobs for those programming and implementing it, which will increase worker output, thus offsetting the added costs.",13,1.0,2024

"It makes those moves based on an algorithm and calculations. 

We have yet to see an AI solve any math problem that a human can't solve. The only problems solved by machines that I am aware of is through raw compute, not through learning via training nueral networks. 

Reinforcement learning on an LLM is already employed, and all that does is weight parameters based on ranking answers. RL is already used a lot, and doesn't lead to LLMs having new capabilities, it just helps train them to be better at doing exactly what they do. AGI and other AI advancements people talk about are not LLMs getting better at being LLMs, but those and AI in general gaining new capabilities, like AlphaGO becoming good at chess.

AI isn't doing any of the things people think it will do, nor is it being programmed to do these things.

AIs will be great at sorting through tranches of data to find things that would take people a prohibitively long time, but there's no indication that AI is going to be able to solve problems that require more than brute force compute. This is something we are nowhere even close to, and it is critical to have AI replace humans in most tasks.

The consensus is that it’s not a good idea at all. The rise of AI tools has the opposite effect on the tech market than outsiders think. It’s harder to get a job now than ever before. Actual AI jobs go to people with PhDs while extremely experienced software engineers with masters are fighting over AI adjacent jobs that don’t necessarily pay more than their old SWE jobs.

"A few things changed that explain the discrepancy between experience and those numbers:

- The numbers of CS grads grew by more than job growth. CS enrolment really skyrocketed exponentially late 2010s, so those all came to job market early to mid 2020s.

- The seniority distribution at Google/Meta is not what it was in 2019. The share of senior engineers is much higher, the share of junior / new grad engineers is now much lower. This creates scarcity of new grad jobs even if the SWE profession overall still looks healthy.

- As CS has become a mainstream major late 2010s, rather than only for the most tech loving nerds as before, the average skill level of new grads has noticeably dropped. This makes hiring managers more skeptical, needing more positive signal from new grads to be convinced.


As a hiring manager myself, that third one is also a big one. I hear all my hiring manager colleagues complain about it.

I can commend the growth of big tech with how many jobs they've created which is good, but if university/colleges keeps taking in students that saturates the pool into criminal levels then people should at least be warned.

Nothing in life is a guarantee, I can agree with that. However I believe people should be well informed to actually make calculated risks.

"I'm honestly really hoping a company goes all in on AI soon.

I use AI everyday and it's an amazing tool, but it's just not a replacement for a person. There are so many common tasks and everyday problems that I can automate, but I have to review every result and when the AI hits it's limit I need to understand all the stuff it did before it got stuck. There's always going to be some threshold with LLM systems and you're going to need experts to solve them.

On top of that, agentic AI can do amazing things, but has also led to some big fuck ups where I work. When it gets things right, the results are magnified. When it gets things wrong, the error cascade and magnify. We had an error in an MCP for writing nodejs files recently that wasn't compatible with our ESLint config. We got into a situation where one agent would generate code, one agent would write the files, and a third agent would run tests and linting. The middle agent couldn't connect to the linting agent, only the initial code generator. The end result is that it ran for a while, burned thorugh a ton of tokens, rewrote a bunch of files that didn't need to be rewritten and eventually just added a bunch of comments that disabled our testing and linting and called it good. If we had shipped that code, it would have been a nightmare.

What I think is going to happen is that some company is going to go all in on agentic AI and it's going to have a runaway process like we had, but in production or with real money at stake. We're trying to simulate fluid intelligence with crystaline intelligence and it's going to break in potentially bad ways.

"This sub is funny sometimes. The fact that it constantly has to make these ""AI doesn't do anything useful"" type of posts/comments betrays a real discomfort at the way software development is changing. It's essentially an attempt to convince itself that it won't change (e.g. copium).

But technology is always changing. Even programming itself has changed significantly in the past 50 years. Computer programming literally used to be done on [punched cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming_in_the_punched_card_era). And then programming languages came along, and over decades, it became more like English and abstracted away to the point where we now have Python.

I think we are seeing something similar with AI in software development. It will become literal natural language being fed into a processor (LLM) to write a program. From punch cards to pseudo-language to natural language sounds like a reasonable evolution of creating computer programs.

My advice is to ignore both the AI hype and the AI naysayers who call it a ""grift"". There is a real utility for AI models. It won't be a perfect solution but it doesn't have to be perfect to make an impact. It just has to do enough.

If you are worried about your job being taken over by AI, you can avoid that by learning how to use AI tools effectively. So maybe try Cursor or Claude Code. Or Windsurf. Whatever tool you like. Be a productive developer who can use AI effectively rather than disavowing AI and calling it a grift. You will be the one that companies will want to hire.",-1,0.0,2025
"I used to think this way too. Now GitHub co-pilot writes at least 30% of the working code for me (usually the ones I know, but lazy to type).

It sure does help a lot and saves my time. I would probably need hours of Google search and multiple blogs to understand what ChatGPT teaches me in 30 mins.

Just because AI cannot solve every programming problem, doesn't mean we need to completely dismiss its abilities. Something like this didn't exist 5 years ago, but it does now and I think adopting to change, especially when it is beneficial to you should not be frowned upon.",-1,0.0,2025

"I've been a GPU programmer for 5/6 years of my professional experience.


I've developed software, using Claude for assistance, that effectively automates my prior role. Writing, debugging, optimizing GPU code.


Anyone that thinks our jobs aren't automatable hasn't worked with LLMs in a novel way that would expose them to any idea otherwise. We simply live in a different world now.


We can argue ""But writing code isn't the whole job"" and that's true. But in five years we can imagine a world in which programmers don't really write code anymore. We can easily imagine full automation taking over aspects of life, like driving. The recently posted Waymo stats are incredible, and demonstrate self driving cars being roughly 90% safer than human driving, over 25 million miles. So too will this happen to writing code: eventually, we simply won't trust humans to write software anymore.


So what does software engineering look like if we're not writing code? I guess one could argue we'll all become system architects, which might not be bad. But that role will not be akin to what it is today, and that will undoubtedly mean one Engineer performing the job of what used to be five or six individual people ranging from Dev Ops, to web development, to system level code to scripting.


It's copium thinking there's nothing to this technology. I'm starting to not feel bad for people who castigate the technology at this point. I do feel bad for people who recognize the threat and can't do much about it, namely those people entering college for CS in September.


If you're someone who has experience in the field, and you also think there's nothing to modern LLMs, then I will salute you as you walk the plank of your own accord. This technology is going to eat every single ""industry"" that humans use to make money.

"Oh don't get me wrong - WITCH companies can burn in hell. They're predatory middlemen sticking their hands in everyone's pockets with shitty benefits, no vacation, and ability to apply far more pressure on contractors as their placements can be trivially terminated.

Also H1B is not a good program. Not defending that either. It does put immigrants in a shitty position because they are so dependent on their employer. Switching jobs is difficult, and losing your job leaves you with very little time to find a new one.

The stupid lottery system alone makes it a joke. There are tons of ways H1B can and should be improved.

However, this narrative that tech companies are hiring H1Bs because they're cheap and whatnot just isn't true. Google is paying the WITCH companies a comparable salary (if not higher) for each contractor as compared to their permanent employees. It's just that the consulting companies take a huge chunk off the top.

The point I'm getting at is that the problem isn't the immigrants, nor the companies who use H1B to bring on talent as full time employees (which costs the company more than it costs to hire an American).

That concept is that someone who has worked in a specific job or area for an extended period of time will know things about how it works that are not immediately identifiable or teachable.  

To put it another way, I built a tool that my job uses for an integral function.  It was complicated and took a couple years.  When things break, I can find them faster because I have some memory of how and why I built the system in the way I did, so I can fix problems faster.  Someone who is a better skilled developer from elsewhere could not match my speed for some period of time (12 months?) of interfacing with the code.  There will always be corners that only I could remember.  So, when you have that situation because someone have been on a Visa for 10 years (yes, it can take that long to get progress toward a Green Card) and you want to cancel the K-1 to hire some random who may or may not be able to cover the integral program for 12 months, which are you choosing?",15,0.9886096914930773,2025

There will be failures that are a direct result of AI, and there will eventually be Lawsuits over the liability of what AI has done.  The end result will be that there will be at least as many jobs required, though some of them will be a bit different.

False - the premise of my argument is that the companies themselves are saying the AI IS that good and are justifying their layoffs because of it while marketing their own capability- in other words “buy into our tech and you can have layoffs too!”

All that said, a Masters degree is a terrible way to keep up with the latest developments in any tech field. Creating an academic class is a lot of work. At a minimum, the syllabus is set at the beginning of the semester. In a fast moving field, that is plenty of time to get behind.

"Everyone is going to tell you something different and biased. 
Here's some perspective. 

It comes down to what you want out of it,.the actual program offered by the uni and the industry where you live.

If you want to be creating new AI / ML algorithms or pushing the boundary further (effectively research) - most of those jobs exist in US / Europe (if you aren't there) and require PhD level research experience and significant output in research. It's also an intersection of computer science and maths. Most people here are more theoretically maths/stats heavy. Think advanced stochastic theory, measure theory, etc.

If you want to be.in the camp of majority of people here / software engineers that want to be implementing, building, or having sufficient conceptual knowledge around AI / ML - then you can get it from any combination of uni, self study, work and practical experience.

Most unis offering these programs are masters by coursework. Some might have a small thesis component or project at the end. A masters by coursework is just units/subjects similar to your undergraduate. Most people take them to shift into a new field. A master by research is for those considering dipping their toes in research - effectively ""create new body of knowledge and how to build on others research"". It's more likely for someone to upgrade their masters by research to a PhD. They are two different purposes.

For your situation - 

You could consider a masters coursework and supplement it with practical experience and self study. 

The industry moves fast and you still won't learn things that people talk about now that trendy like mcp, ai agents, LLM, rag, all those tools people talk about like cursor / Claude etc.  These are just implementations / practical applications and they will change quick, some will be adopted and accepted and other dropped.

The masters program would be useful if you need a planned study program and if you wanted theoretical foundation that underpin AI  (provided the uni program unit) such as statistical learning, machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning Bayesian theory... How hopfield neutral networks work , Monte Carlo etc work. Remember ML / AI is actually intersection of CS and Maths. So when you pick a uni program, make sure it has a balance of CS and Stats.

During the railroad craze in USA everyone where either supplier of railroads or workers, laying down the rails. Once the bubble burst the entire sector died over night. However the rails of the unfinished projects, scattered all over USA were still around, and new companies formed and used the remains to finish it, during this time it ""appeard"" that no new hires were made. But hirening resumed once the surplus ran out.  


Same could be said today. In the technology sector we had a huge influx of hires working on infrastructure like datacenters and such for Big Data, cloud services and VR, the catalyst for this was cheaply borrowed money.

This resulted in a huge surplus in infrastrucutre like the remaining railroads.

"I manage a small manufacturing and sales company. Among my many duties is hiring workers. It is not something I enjoy doing, so I put a lot of emphasis on locating workers who don't job hop. I don't want to be constantly losing another week of my work life to screen and interview and then the indeterminable hours spent on onboarding and training coupled with the lost productivity as the new hire learns the position.

I just hired to replace a worker who resigned. $20 - $23/hr entry level 40 hr position in San Antonio. 160 resumes arrived in the first 24 hours, up to over 240 in 7 days. It's challenging to weed through that many documents. I am an incredibly fast reader and it took me much of a day.  I use criteria just so I can chop that number down to something that I can manage.  Exclude the people who change jobs every six months. Exclude people who are very underqualified. Exclude people from outside of the San Antonio area, I'm not going to ask someone to move for a $20/hr job. That gets rid of half. Exclude people who have held senior management positions, I don't need to manage another ego. Exclude people from other career fields who send in their career resume, I always get marketing, programming, and medical resumes for customer service positions, if you're sending out your career resume to something outside of your career field you need to rework that thing. 

I try to get that number down to 40 or so. I then send an email that requires the applicant to write a sample customer service email, send that email to my work email address, and include their interview availability so I can schedule an interview.  I want to make certain the applicant can write well and follow instructions. 10 replied over the next three days.  All were scheduled for an interview.  3 people no-showed for the interviews. One showed up under the influence. Two were very good and the rest were just okay and would have probably worked out.

"Hey fellow IT person. 
So it indeed IS getting savage out there. 
Understand that when you see engineer it really means engineer. 
If you are going from helpdesk, no one is going to hire you for anything but Jr sysadmin. 
It isn't just about knowing diagnostics and basic systems. 
You have to have a broad infrastructure knowledge of all the IT systems involved now. 
Multiple cloud platforms as well. 
It is a HUGE skill gap in not just advanced diagnostics, but buildouts, maintenance, and even terminology. 

You have to know the OSI model and many security based models to be in engineering.

Scripting and automation is almost an everyday used skill. 
I sot in code windows more than I sit in GUIs. 

When you get into Cloud systems engineering like me, you will have to know API and programming languages for integration and automation services. 
Familiarity with basic to advanced app development infrastructure lifecycle as well. 

Helpdesk is a walk in the park comparatively. 

I learned that the hard way when I got a role as a Jr Sysadmin at a company with skilled Engineers and admins. 
It was humbling and showed me how little I really knew even after half a decade on desktop support engineering and Lead. 

If you want to break out, I HIGHLY recommend finding a local MSP. 
They will put you through the FIRE! 
My hardest jobs were MSPs but damn did they teach me SO MUCH!

Also 10 years is WAY too long to stay in helpdesk tier 1-3. 
You have to push hard if you want to be better. 
Study, study, study!
make a home lab. 
sign up for a free on Microsoft learn and take the AZ-900, AZ-800/801 cert courses.
You don't have to get the cert but finish the courses and get your completion trophies so you can showcase then on your resume/portfolio site.

Administration and Engjneering is no joke and it gets savage at the top and the demand for broad knowledge is HIGH. 

Rule of thumb: If you dont get a raise your first year and a promotion your second year after hitting your milestones, take your work and find another place. 
It is just business, and it also exposes you to different environments which keeps you sharp; It also let's you build your resume, portfolio, and bump your pay due to experience.

"Dude, first things first,  stop beating yourself up. You're 26 with an MCA degree, not 46 with zero tech background. The ""wasted 3 years"" thing? Yeah that sucks but honestly, half the people I know took weird detours before figuring their shit out.

Your customer service experience is actually way more valuable than you think. I've seen so many developers who can code but cant talk to humans without making them want to punch something. You've got that soft skill locked down already.

Here's my take on your options.. 

Full stack development is probably your best bet given your MCA background. The transition will feel more natural and bootcamps can get you job-ready in 3-6 months. At Metana we've had people with similar backgrounds land jobs pretty quickly because the demand is still there despite all the doom and gloom.

Cloud computing is also solid.. AWS certs are still opening doors and companies need people who understand both the tech AND can explain it to confused customers (hello, your superpower).

Data analytics could work too but honestly? The entry level market got flooded recently so it might take longer to break in.

Skip AI/ML for now unless you're really into math. Everyone thinks its the golden ticket but most companies still need basic full stack devs more than ML engineers.

My advice would be to pick full stack development, commit to a structured program (bootcamp or really good online course), and start building projects immediately. Don't just do tutorials. Build actual stuff you can show employers.

The market is tough but not impossible. Companies are just being pickier, which means you need to be undeniably good at what you do.

Stop overthinking and start coding something today. Even if its just a basic todo app.",0,1.0,2025
"My suggestion be pick one track, get hands-on with a structured program (e.g., AWS or Azure certification for cloud, or a solid full-stack bootcamp that forces you to build projects).

Cybersecurity and AI/ML are great but usually require either prior IT exposure or advanced math/stats background they’re better as specializations later.

Your empathy, resilience, and lived experience are strong assets in that field.

The software engineer route though... that's interesting. You've got the analytical background from petroleum engineering and finance, plus an MBA. That's actually a solid combo for tech. You don't necessarily need a full CS masters either, there are faster paths like bootcamps that can get you there in 6-12 months instead of 2+ years.

The red flags you've identified are real concerns. Working without proper testing, code reviews, or modern tooling will hurt your marketability long-term. While your current environment sounds pleasant, you risk becoming the senior developer who doesn't know current practices five years from now. Technical stagnation is a career killer in this field.

However, don't rush into anything. Start learning those technologies on your own time, build side projects using modern stacks, and gradually assess what's available in your market. You can use a service like Applyre to passively explore opportunities while staying employed. This way you can be selective about your next move rather than desperate.

"Hi. You just commented on my Arthur Rachman post. 

It just so happens that your request here is something I know a lot about. Before I retired 10 years ago I ran professional services at several business software companies. 

Honestly I would have killed to hire someone with your skill set. My most recent company made software for manufacturing companies. An ERP specifically for small batch manufacturers like beer, drugs, weed, candy, and all sorts of meat products. Our software was highly configurable.

We were always on the lookout for people that could mix technology like sql queries and report creation with business process design / redesign to help a business use our software to streamline their  processes. A LOT of businesses have islands of information, based in access or excel. My team learned their processes, mapped them to our best practice using our software, converted the data, trained them on the new software and processes, and helped them document their new processes based on our templates.

If it sounds like a position designed for your skills, look at ERP software companies and job titles like Business Process Engineer or Solutions Architect.

10 years ago our starting salary was around 60k with NO relevant technical experience. With the experience you bring to the table, around 90k to start. Again that was 10 years ago. These positions required a lot of client facing zoom meetings and about 25% back then. Since the pandemic I'm thinking there is more remote work today. Each company is different.

A few companies to review: Blue Yonder, Epicore, and ECI Solutions, but there are literally hundreds of others. From the very large like Oracle, SAP, Salesforce to the 10 person startup.

"I agree with what a lot of people are saying. To answer your question: yes, there are Data Science use cases in both Networking and Cybersecurity. 

For Networking, Data Science can be used in monitoring network performance, as an ancillary tool in how to determine optimal use of networking resources, and even the forecasting of network traffic demand/use. Some of what I described will naturally bleed over into Cybersecurity (Cybersecurity as a field is heavily based on Networking). However, I do not believe that there are a lot of jobs in this field and the job title may not be ""Data Scientist"". Here are a few jobs that at least somewhat fit the description that I laid out (sorry that I cannot find more recent roles):

For Cybersecurity, there are a lot of cool use cases for Data Science. From everything such as visualizing attacks across an organization, to log analytics, to creating models that aid in mitigating vulnerabilities (even research roles!), the field is vast and growing. Here are some examples:

"Hey, I really appreciate how honestly you’ve laid this out — I’ve been in a similar fork-in-the-road situation, so I’ll share my thoughts.

If stability, growth, and peace of mind are your top priorities, I’d lean toward Company 2 (ML Engineer working with LLMs). But if familiarity, strong alignment with your core skills, and a great interview experience matter more, then Company 1 (Data Scientist in Fintech) might be the better fit.

For Company 1, the pros are clear: you felt good about the interview process and can see yourself succeeding — that’s a huge green flag in terms of team and culture fit. Plus, working on churn and ARR models means staying grounded in classic data science problems that are always in demand. But the cons are hard to ignore. A strict 5-day in-office policy can be draining, especially long-term. Also, the fact that this role won’t involve any engineering or productionizing work could limit your growth if you want to stay technical. And while they’re hiring again, a history of layoffs still signals some instability.

Company 2, on the other hand, seems better aligned with your PhD, past role, and technical skillset. Working with agentic AI and LLMs is definitely more on the cutting edge, and the fact that the team is growing is a positive sign. That said, I totally understand the frustration of spending weeks on latency or infra work — it’s not always glamorous, and it’s easy to feel disconnected from the “AI magic.” But that’s part of the reality of shipping production AI. Your “okayish” interview experience might be worth unpacking too — was it nerves, or does it point to a culture mismatch?

If I were you, I’d ask:
	1.	In 2–3 years, what kind of role do I want?
	2.	Which team excites me more when I imagine starting on a Monday morning?
	3.	Am I more interested in leveling up my engineering chops, or going deeper in data/business impact?

For what it’s worth — I work at a company that hasn’t fully implemented AI, and yes, there’s some FOMO. But there’s also opportunity. You see the gaps, and if you can bring in AI thoughtfully, you become a multiplier. I’ve seen folks succeed not by chasing hype, but by solving real problems extremely well — and introducing AI when the org is ready.

You don’t always need to be on the bleeding edge. Sometimes, you just need to be needed.

Hope that helps a bit. Whichever direction you go, your self-awareness and clarity really stand out — I’m sure you’ll thrive. Keep us updated!",0,1.0,2025
"There was once shortage of people in data science. That is not longer the case, as people from all over the world jumped into this new and ""sexy"" career - at the start, there were few degree programs, but these proliferated, as did online courses, and the gap got filled.

Data science freelancing is probably no longer a good option.

Too many people tried to get into this field when jobs were growing, and now that jobs are going away, that means that a big crop of fresh grads is just not going to work in this industry, because they will be forced to get a different job.

Now, at some point jobs will start coming back, and it will probably coincide with a really low supply of talent.

"I would say that up to like 2020 or so, we were at a talent deficit. People needed to hire like crazy, and there just weren't enough candidates. That triggered a job market where literally you could take a 3 month Python bootcamp and then get a job as a developer, data scientist, analyst, etc.

Not only that, but then the people who had a legit DS, CS background where being fought for to a degree that meant that people were getting just unheard of comp packages. 

Up to that point, I think the increased enrollment in CS was probably matching, generally speaking, the growth of the industry. Maybe even lagging a little bit. 

But when 2020 hit and everything went through the roof, *that* is when things went to hell, because two things happened:

1. The CS enrollment now matched the industry growth - which was a completely unsustainable growth. Like, we knew we couldn't keep growing jobs at that rate. And the issue is that enrollment leads grads by 4 years, so the kids that enrolled in CS in 2020/2021 are now graduating and looking for jobs.

2. The job market didn't just not keep growing - we hit economic issues and the market started shrinking. 

>I personally believe a lot of them are just in it for the fat paychecks (nothing wrong with that tbh, but so many candidates means those are going to get small for entry level employees).

I actually don't think the paychecks are going to get substantially smaller than like 2019 money (definitely smaller than 2020/2021 money), but that's because when you need less talent, you are also going to aim for top-end talent, which will still cost money because people will still fight for top talent fresh grads.

"The AI hype will eventually blow over (it might take the economy down with it) if you wanted to just go do something else for a while (like a temporary return to insurance). Having actually worked very closely with language models as transformers started taking over, I can state categorically that the management class believes in a literal fantasy version of what these things can do.

Eventually, you gotta deliver products. Ones that people want to use.

That said, I think it's worth considering if you would want to be in DS on the other side of that. My hot take is that the culture of data science is absolute dog water. Too many people bringing all of the worst parts of academia (the isolation, the zero-sum mentality, that particular brand of politics that pretends to be progressive/accepting yet in reality is the same ""old boys club"" of hiring all the people from your Alma Matter because somehow magically all the good DS come from {insert Uni you went too how convenient}). I'm not willing to put up with that AND professional manager types. I left academia for a reason. And I've left DS for largely the *same* reason.

Not to doom over it, but I think the era of inferential data scientists is largely over. I don't know what will emerge on the other side of the LLM apocolypse once people start putting chatgpt segfaults into prod or cause Netflix to spend 4 billion dollars on Boss Baby sequels because someone with ""principal"" in front of their title decided to just yolo a PR, but I think again the management class has largely figured out that DS didn't do what they wanted. It provided counter-evidence against the sort of businessy hand waving they love so much. Every counterintuitive discovery that makes a DS' year enranges a VP who really thinks you're just a monkey there to dance for them.

Unless selling data science products is our business, we are in a support role and we are there to build stuff that help business sell something better/save money. Nothing more or less. If you want to feel meaningful then pick an industry/cause that makes you feel fulfilled or at least happy helping. 

Business has always been blind to what truly is causal vs not or ML vs just heuristics and tbh it’s not their job. It’s our and our DS leadership’s job to communicate, educate them but we have failed to do so and broadly failed to show the meaningful marginal roi of chasing after causality over just correlational signals backed by on business understanding.

The main challenge is that most of them highly prefer Electrical or Mechanical Engineering degrees, and I only have hobby-level knowledge in either of those disciplines",0,0.9320413043552781,2025
"The issue I have with models and AI as I have seen it is ""people think it works, I know it's not going to work, and then it doesn't work."" I am amazed, for example, how many people think they can replicate some sort of customer-service decision-tree structure using an LLM only to be shocked that it doesn't work.",18,1.0,2025
"Yea, that’s true but I suspect we are undergoing a significant culture shift that is worse for the specialists brought on by many things including AI but not exclusive to AI. The mangers think they can know as much in one hour as a specialist that spends 100 hours. Which begs the question why was the specialist hired. The answer is they could have been hired for reasons completely unrelated to how they will be evaluated - because at the same time as technological advancement capital is increasingly distant from the business operations and revenue. The VCs funding the company think the same about their specialists.

I’ll go ahead and make this less vague: I had a situation where I did spend 100 hours fully understanding the meaning of some data and I communicated it effectively. Once I figured it out, it was as simple as the fact you couldn’t retain duplicate information in a specific table. Everyone understood this.except the business owner, and it became a point of contention. No AI involved. I fixed it and no good deed goes unpunished. IMO I was hired because it would raise the company sell price and lock me out from competing, and the business owner thought it would be best to not let me work when his ego got in the way.",-1,0.0,2025
"You're not going to like what I have to say, I suspect... but I'll be honest with you here. From my casual observation, actuarial science hiring peaked in 2012. Data science hiring peaked in 2016.

This is the worst job market I've seen in my lifetime as an employed adult. Ngl. I'm about ~110 apps submitted in 2 months and I'm going to keep at this for some time. I can tell.

The TL;DR is take what you can get. But the thing about either path you're considering is that as you know, it's a lot of committment.

I still mentor students in my free time and a lot of them, like you, ask some variation of ""what degree is worth it right now?""

It's hard to say. We don't live in normal times right now.

My suggestion is as it was to when I was teaching students back in ~2019: go look at job postings in your desired location and see what may interest you, and tailor your path to those job descriptions. I'm sorry I don't have anything more specific at this time, but that's the best I've got. Do this over a multi-week and maybe even multi-month process. Just spend like half an hour each week (at least) just looking at job postings and see what's out there. Then come up with a plan accordingly.

Hope that helps.",0,1.0,2025
"Unfortunately, you are correct.

1) This sounds like the person is burnt out. This is a completely normal thing to go through. Working on yourself and leaving DS will be beneficial.

2) GenAI is here to stay. That doesn't mean it's a fairy tale magic wand that some in society think it is. But it's clear that it has many very strong use cases.

"Hi OP, my company is hiring. I will PM you.

Interpretable ML is still a huge effort in the insurance industry. The “why” is important, and vetting every model in every market is important. My experience is, leadership would much rather implement GLMs than blindly trust algorithmic black boxes. We develop univariate plots and market segmentation models to really understand how the models work. Statistics reigns supreme not Gen AI, outside of a few niche cases. There is room to use boosting and ensembles although GLMs (albeit regularized ones with careful variable transformations) still have their place.",-1,0.0,2025

"To emphasize this: communication and stakeholder management have and will always be my favorite part of the job. It is part of why I loved being a statistician. 

However, it seems like ever since ChatGPT came out, people have already made up their minds on what AI, etc. can do and they've decided it *must* be that way. The main thing I miss about statistics is being *trusted* with my expertise and coming up with a solution, not being told how to solve a problem and being demanded to approach it that way.",28,1.0,2025
You’ll need to retake all the exams and it’s a boring but stable industry that is also very behind the times. Dunno if you’re ok with all that. It is stable it is good pay but my actuary friends all tell me it felt soulless and non-innovative.,0,0.6455952876928075,2025

"Hard to say what happens to us as LLMs (continue to) perform our work at and above human level. One could argue it will free us to do even more interesting things as we will have extra time and it won’t be wasted on menial tasks. Of course, the “extra time” will certainly be seen by many companies as a sign that data scientists can be safely laid off.

I’m fairly confident the latter will be the outcome for most of us in the next decade or two. This sub doesn’t like it when I make these kinds of noises, but I’m not going to get on the “LLMs are just another tool and will create jobs” bandwagon just for internet points",-1,0.0,2024
